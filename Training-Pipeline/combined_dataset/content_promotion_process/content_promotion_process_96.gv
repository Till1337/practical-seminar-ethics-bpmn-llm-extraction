The text below is about the content promotion process. It starts with preparing a summary of your content. 
After preparing a summary of your content, the next tasks should be deep-linking to the content from older posts, repurposing your content and commenting on related blog posts, they should be done in parallel. 
When commenting on related blog posts is completed, the next tasks should be posting on related forums and groups and posting on Q&A sites, they should be done in parallel. 
Once posting on Q&A sites occurs, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: submitting to link roundups and sharing on social media. 
The process is now completed.
