The following description is about the project management process. It begins when you make an introduction. 
When making an introduction is completed, identifying the approval status should be taken into account. if all approved, then nothing needs to be done, otherwise you should record the basic idea. 
Afterwards, stating the available resources needs to be done. 
When stating the available resources is completed, having a kickoff meeting needs to be done. 
After having a kickoff meeting, keeping communication should be done.
