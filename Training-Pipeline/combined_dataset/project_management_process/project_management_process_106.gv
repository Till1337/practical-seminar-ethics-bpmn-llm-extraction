The following description is about the project management process. It starts with making an introduction. 
After making an introduction, identifying the approval status should be considered. if all approved, then nothing needs to be done, otherwise you should get approval. 
Afterwards, stating the available resources should be done. 
When stating the available resources is completed, you need to have a kickoff meeting.
Once having a kickoff meeting occurs, one or more of the following paths should be executed: keeping communication, recording KPIs. 
Afterwards, terminating contractors should be done. 
The process is now completed.
