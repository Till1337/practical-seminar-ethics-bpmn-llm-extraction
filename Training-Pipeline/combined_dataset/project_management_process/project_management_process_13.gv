The text below is about the project management process. It begins when you make an introduction. 
When making an introduction is completed, recording the basic idea needs to be done. 
Once recording the basic idea occurs, you need to draw up a project plan.
Once drawing up a project plan occurs, having a kickoff meeting should be done. 
Once having a kickoff meeting occurs, keeping communication needs to be done. 
When keeping communication is completed, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: evaluating project outcomes and terminating contractors. 
The process is now completed.
