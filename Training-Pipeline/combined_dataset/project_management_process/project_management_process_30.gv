The text below is about the project management process. It starts with making an introduction. 
When making an introduction is completed, you need to identify the approval status.
Once identifying the approval status occurs, one or more of the following paths should be executed: drawing up a project plan, setting a budget. 
Afterwards, having a kickoff meeting needs to be done. 
After having a kickoff meeting, recording KPIs needs to be done. 
When recording KPIs is completed, evaluating project outcomes should be done. 
The process is now completed.
