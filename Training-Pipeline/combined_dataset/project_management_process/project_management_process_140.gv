The text below is about the project management process. It starts with making an introduction. 
Once making an introduction occurs, one or more of the following paths should be executed: getting approval, working out its value. 
When getting approval is completed, identifying the approval status needs to be done. 
After that, one or more of the following paths should be executed: laying out a timeline, drawing up a project plan. 
After that, having a kickoff meeting needs to be done. 
When having a kickoff meeting is completed, one or more of the following paths should be executed: recording KPIs, keeping communication. 
Then, the next tasks should be terminating contractors and ensuring the project is completed, they should be done in parallel. 
The process is now completed.
