The following description is about the project management process. It starts with making an introduction. 
After making an introduction, the process is split into 3 parallel branches: working out its value, getting approval and recording the basic idea. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then the process is split into 3 parallel branches: stating the available resources, drawing up a project plan and laying out a timeline. 
When laying out a timeline is completed, you need to set a budget.
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then having a kickoff meeting should be done. 
Once having a kickoff meeting occurs, the next tasks should be recording KPIs and keeping communication, they should be done in parallel. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then ensuring the project is completed needs to be done. 
The process is now completed.
