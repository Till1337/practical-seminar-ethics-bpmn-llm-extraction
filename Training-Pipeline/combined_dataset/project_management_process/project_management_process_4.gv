The text below is about the project management process. It begins when you make an introduction. 
After making an introduction, you need to get approval.
When getting approval is completed, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: drawing up a project plan and setting a budget. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then you need to have a kickoff meeting.
Once having a kickoff meeting occurs, keeping communication needs to be done. 
When keeping communication is completed, evaluating project outcomes needs to be done. 
The process is now completed.
