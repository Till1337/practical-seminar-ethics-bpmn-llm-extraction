The following text is about the project management process. It starts with making an introduction. 
After making an introduction, you need to get approval.
After getting approval, drawing up a project plan needs to be done. 
Once drawing up a project plan occurs, having a kickoff meeting should be done. 
When having a kickoff meeting is completed, one or more of the following paths should be executed: recording KPIs, keeping communication. 
Then, the next tasks should be ensuring the project is completed and terminating contractors, they should be done in parallel. 
The process is now completed.
