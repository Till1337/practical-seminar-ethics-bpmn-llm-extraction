The following description is about the project management process. It starts with making an introduction. 
Once making an introduction occurs, identifying the approval status should be taken into account. if all approved, then nothing needs to be done, otherwise you should record the basic idea. 
Then, you need to lay out a timeline.
When laying out a timeline is completed, having a kickoff meeting needs to be done. 
After having a kickoff meeting, you need to keep communication.
When keeping communication is completed, the next tasks should be evaluating project outcomes and terminating contractors, they should be done in parallel. 
The process is now completed.
