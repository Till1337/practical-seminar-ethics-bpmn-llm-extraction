The text below is about the project management process. It starts with making an introduction. 
After making an introduction, the process is split into 3 parallel branches: identifying the approval status, recording the basic idea and working out its value. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then the next tasks should be laying out a timeline, setting a budget and stating the available resources, they should be done in parallel. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then you need to have a kickoff meeting.
Once having a kickoff meeting occurs, keeping communication needs to be done. 
Once keeping communication occurs, one or more of the following paths should be executed: terminating contractors, ensuring the project is completed. 
The process is now completed.
