The following description is about the project management process. It starts with making an introduction. 
Once making an introduction occurs, recording the basic idea should be done. 
After recording the basic idea, one or more of the following paths should be executed: stating the available resources, setting a budget. 
Afterwards, having a kickoff meeting should be done. 
Once having a kickoff meeting occurs, keeping communication needs to be done. 
After keeping communication, evaluating project outcomes should be done. 
The process is now completed.
