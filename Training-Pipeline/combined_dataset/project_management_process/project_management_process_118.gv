The text below is about the project management process. It begins when you make an introduction. 
When making an introduction is completed, identifying the approval status should be considered. if all approved, then nothing needs to be done, otherwise you should work out its value. 
When working out its value is completed, one or more of the following paths should be executed: getting approval, identifying the approval status. 
Then, you need to draw up a project plan.
After drawing up a project plan, you need to have a kickoff meeting.
Once having a kickoff meeting occurs, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: recording KPIs and keeping communication. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then the next tasks should be evaluating project outcomes and ensuring the project is completed, they should be done in parallel. 
When ensuring the project is completed is completed, you need to terminate contractors.
The process is now completed.
