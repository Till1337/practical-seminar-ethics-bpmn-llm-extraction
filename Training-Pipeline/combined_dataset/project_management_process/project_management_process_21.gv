The following text is about the project management process. It starts with making an introduction. 
Once making an introduction occurs, working out its value should be done. 
After working out its value, setting a budget needs to be done. 
When setting a budget is completed, you need to have a kickoff meeting.
Once having a kickoff meeting occurs, the next tasks should be recording KPIs and keeping communication, they should be done in parallel. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then you need to ensure the project is completed.
The process is now completed.
