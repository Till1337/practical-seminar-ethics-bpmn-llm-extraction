The following text is about the project management process. It begins when you make an introduction. 
Once making an introduction occurs, the next tasks should be identifying the approval status and getting approval, they should be done in parallel. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then the next tasks should be drawing up a project plan and stating the available resources, they should be done in parallel. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then having a kickoff meeting needs to be done. 
Once having a kickoff meeting occurs, you need to record KPIs.
After recording KPIs, one or more of the following paths should be executed: ensuring the project is completed, evaluating project outcomes. 
The process is now completed.
