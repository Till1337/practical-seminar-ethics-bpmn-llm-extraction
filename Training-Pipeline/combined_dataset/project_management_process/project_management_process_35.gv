The following description is about the project management process. It begins when you make an introduction. 
When making an introduction is completed, identifying the approval status should be taken into account. if all approved, then nothing needs to be done, otherwise you should work out its value. 
Afterwards, the next tasks should be stating the available resources and setting a budget, they should be done in parallel. 
When stating the available resources is completed, you need to lay out a timeline.
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then having a kickoff meeting needs to be done. 
Once having a kickoff meeting occurs, recording KPIs should be done. 
After recording KPIs, ensuring the project is completed needs to be done. 
The process is now completed.
