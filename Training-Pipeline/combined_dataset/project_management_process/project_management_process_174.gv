The text below is about the project management process. It begins when you make an introduction. 
When making an introduction is completed, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: identifying the approval status and recording the basic idea. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then one or more of the following paths should be executed: stating the available resources, setting a budget. 
When stating the available resources is completed, one or more of the following paths should be executed: drawing up a project plan, laying out a timeline. 
After that, having a kickoff meeting should be done. 
When having a kickoff meeting is completed, keeping communication should be done. 
Once keeping communication occurs, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: terminating contractors and evaluating project outcomes. 
The process is now completed.
