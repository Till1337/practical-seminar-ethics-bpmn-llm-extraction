The following text is about the project management process. It begins when you make an introduction. 
After making an introduction, you need to identify the approval status.
After identifying the approval status, drawing up a project plan needs to be done.

After having a kickoff meeting, one or more of the following paths should be executed: recording KPIs, keeping communication. 
Then, one or more of the following paths should be executed: evaluating project outcomes, terminating contractors.
