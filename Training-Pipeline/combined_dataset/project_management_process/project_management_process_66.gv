The text below is about the project management process. It starts with making an introduction. 
After making an introduction, the process is split into 3 parallel branches: recording the basic idea, getting approval and identifying the approval status. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then you need to set a budget.
When setting a budget is completed, you need to have a kickoff meeting.
Once having a kickoff meeting occurs, recording KPIs needs to be done. 
After recording KPIs, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: ensuring the project is completed and evaluating project outcomes. 
The process is now completed.
