The following description is about the project management process. It starts with making an introduction. 
Once making an introduction occurs, identifying the approval status should be considered. if all approved, then nothing needs to be done, otherwise you should work out its value. 
Afterwards, drawing up a project plan needs to be done. 
After drawing up a project plan, having a kickoff meeting needs to be done. 
After having a kickoff meeting, you need to record KPIs.
After recording KPIs, you need to terminate contractors.
The process is now completed.
