The following text is about the account payable process. It begins when you send to the vendor accounting department. 
After sending to the vendor accounting department, you need to create a receiving report.
Once creating a receiving report occurs, reporting errors to relevant team member should be done. 
After reporting errors to relevant team member, the next tasks should be storing in paid invoice file and checking dates to avoid penalty charges, they should be done in parallel. 
The process is now completed.
