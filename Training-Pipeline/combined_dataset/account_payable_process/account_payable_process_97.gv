The text below is about the account payable process. It starts with sending to the receiving department. 
When sending to the receiving department is completed, creating a receiving report needs to be done. 
Once creating a receiving report occurs, you need to report errors to relevant team member.
After reporting errors to relevant team member, the next tasks should be checking dates to avoid penalty charges and entering the invoice into the accounts payable account, they should be done in parallel. 
After entering the invoice into the accounts payable account, one or more of the following paths should be executed: stamping all documents, scheduling the payment.
