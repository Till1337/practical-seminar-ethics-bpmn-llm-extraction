The following description is about the account payable process. It begins when you file a copy for internal records. 
When filing a copy for internal records is completed, you need to create a receiving report.
Once creating a receiving report occurs, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: gathering the receiving report and confirming all documents have been amended. 
After gathering the receiving report, the next tasks should be reporting errors to relevant team member, gathering the vendors invoice and doubling check a three-way match, they should be done in parallel. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then you need to create voucher for the documents.
The process is now completed.
