The following description is about the account payable process. It starts with filing a copy for internal records. 
After filing a copy for internal records, creating a receiving report should be done. 
When creating a receiving report is completed, one or more of the following paths should be executed: gathering the vendors invoice, reporting errors to relevant team member. 
After reporting errors to relevant team member, doubling check a three-way match needs to be done. 
After that, you need to enter the invoice into the accounts payable account.
