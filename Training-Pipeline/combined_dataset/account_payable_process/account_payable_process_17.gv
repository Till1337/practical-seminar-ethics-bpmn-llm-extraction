The following text is about the account payable process. It begins when you send to the receiving department. 
When sending to the receiving department is completed, you need to create a receiving report.
After creating a receiving report, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: gathering the receiving report and reporting errors to relevant team member. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then you need to enter the invoice into the accounts payable account.
The process is now completed.
