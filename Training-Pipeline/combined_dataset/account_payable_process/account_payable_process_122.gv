The following description is about the account payable process. It starts with sending to the receiving department. 
Once sending to the receiving department occurs, creating a receiving report needs to be done. 
After creating a receiving report, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: reporting errors to relevant team member and doubling check a three-way match. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then the next tasks should be creating voucher for the documents, storing in paid invoice file and entering the invoice into the accounts payable account, they should be done in parallel. 
When creating voucher for the documents is completed, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: checking dates to avoid penalty charges and scheduling the payment. 
The process is now completed.
