The following description is about the account payable process. It begins when you send to the receiving department. 
When sending to the receiving department is completed, creating a receiving report should be done. 
After creating a receiving report, the next tasks should be gathering the vendors invoice, confirming all documents have been amended and reporting errors to relevant team member, they should be done in parallel. 
After confirming all documents have been amended, you need to double check a three-way match.
