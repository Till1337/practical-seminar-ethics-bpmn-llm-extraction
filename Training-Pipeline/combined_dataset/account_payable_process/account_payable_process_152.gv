The text below is about the account payable process. It begins when you send to the receiving department. 
When sending to the receiving department is completed, creating a receiving report should be done. 
When creating a receiving report is completed, reporting errors to relevant team member should be done. 
Once reporting errors to relevant team member occurs, creating voucher for the documents needs to be done.
