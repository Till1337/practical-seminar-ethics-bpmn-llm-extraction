The following text is about the account payable process. It begins when you send to the vendor accounting department. 
When sending to the vendor accounting department is completed, you need to create a receiving report.
When creating a receiving report is completed, the process is split into 3 parallel branches: confirming all documents have been amended, gathering the receiving report and doubling check a three-way match. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then stamping all documents needs to be done. 
The process is now completed.
