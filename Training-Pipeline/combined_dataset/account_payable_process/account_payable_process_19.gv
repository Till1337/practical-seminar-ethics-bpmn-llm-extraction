The text below is about the account payable process. It starts with sending to the vendor accounting department. 
Once sending to the vendor accounting department occurs, you need to create a receiving report.
After creating a receiving report, the next tasks should be reporting errors to relevant team member, gathering the receiving report and doubling check a three-way match, they should be done in parallel. 
When reporting errors to relevant team member is completed, confirming all documents have been amended should be done. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then you need to check dates to avoid penalty charges.
The process is now completed.
