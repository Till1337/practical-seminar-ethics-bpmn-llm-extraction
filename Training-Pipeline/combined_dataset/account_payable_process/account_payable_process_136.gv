The text below is about the account payable process. It begins when you send to the receiving department. 
Once sending to the receiving department occurs, creating a receiving report should be done. 
Once creating a receiving report occurs, you need to report errors to relevant team member.
After reporting errors to relevant team member, one or more of the following paths should be executed: entering the invoice into the accounts payable account, scheduling the payment. 
The process is now completed.
