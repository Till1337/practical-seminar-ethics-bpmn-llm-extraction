The following text is about the account payable process. It starts with filing a copy for internal records. 
When filing a copy for internal records is completed, creating a receiving report should be done. 
Once creating a receiving report occurs, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: confirming all documents have been amended and gathering the vendors invoice. 
When gathering the vendors invoice is completed, you need to gather the receiving report.
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then the process is split into 2 parallel branches: checking dates to avoid penalty charges and entering the invoice into the accounts payable account. 
The process is now completed.
