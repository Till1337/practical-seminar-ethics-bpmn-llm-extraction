The text below is about the employee onboarding process. It begins when you make an introduction. 
After making an introduction, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: getting approval and preparing benefits package. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then the process is split into 2 parallel branches: inducting into company culture and taking out to lunch. 
When inducting into company culture is completed, touring the office needs to be done. 
When taking out to lunch is completed, the next tasks should be assigning training material and holding a welcoming ceremony, they should be done in parallel. 
Once holding a welcoming ceremony occurs, one or more of the following paths should be executed: explaining your expectations, assigning a mentor. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then getting approval needs to be done. 
When getting approval is completed, explaining long-term goals needs to be done. 
The process is now completed.
