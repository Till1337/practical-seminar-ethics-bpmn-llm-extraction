The following text is about the employee onboarding process. It starts with making an introduction. 
After making an introduction, providing a job description with responsibilities needs to be done. 
Once providing a job description with responsibilities occurs, inducting into company culture should be done. 
When inducting into company culture is completed, checking the paperwork needs to be done. 
After checking the paperwork, you need to review onboarding process over the next 60 days.
