The following description is about the employee onboarding process. It begins when you make an introduction. 
After making an introduction, creating accounts should be done. 
When creating accounts is completed, you need to tour the office.
Once touring the office occurs, getting approval should be done. 
When getting approval is completed, the next tasks should be planning check-in meetings and providing reading material for personal growth, they should be done in parallel. 
Once planning check-in meetings occurs, explaining long-term goals needs to be done. 
The process is now completed.
