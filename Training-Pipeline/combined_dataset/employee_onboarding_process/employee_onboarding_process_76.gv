The following text is about the employee onboarding process. It begins when you make an introduction. 
Once making an introduction occurs, one or more of the following paths should be executed: creating accounts, assigning required reading materials, getting approval. 
When getting approval is completed, preparing employee's workstation needs to be done. 
Then, you need to tour the office.
Once touring the office occurs, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: explaining expectations for the following month and checking the paperwork. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then one or more of the following paths should be executed: planning check-in meetings, providing reading material for personal growth. 
The process is now completed.
