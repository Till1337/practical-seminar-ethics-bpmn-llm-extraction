The following text is about the employee onboarding process. It begins when you make an introduction. 
When making an introduction is completed, you need to provide a job description with responsibilities.
When providing a job description with responsibilities is completed, inducting into company culture should be done.

After that, one or more of the following paths should be executed: explaining long-term goals, planning check-in meetings, encouraging them to socially interact with the team. 
When encouraging them to socially interact with the team is completed, one or more of the following paths should be executed: providing reading material for personal growth, reviewing onboarding process over the next 60 days.
