The following text is about the employee onboarding process. It begins when you make an introduction. 
Once making an introduction occurs, one or more of the following paths should be executed: getting approval, giving access to any tools they will need. 
Then, one or more of the following paths should be executed: holding a welcoming ceremony, touring the office. 
After that, the next tasks should be explaining expectations for the following month and checking the paperwork, they should be done in parallel. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then reviewing onboarding process over the next 60 days should be done.
