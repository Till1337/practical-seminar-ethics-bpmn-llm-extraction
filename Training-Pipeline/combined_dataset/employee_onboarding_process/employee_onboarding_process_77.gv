The following description is about the employee onboarding process. It starts with making an introduction. 
After making an introduction, discussing role, goals and projects with supervisor needs to be done. 
After discussing role, goals and projects with supervisor, one or more of the following paths should be executed: inducting into company culture, assigning a mentor. 
Once assigning a mentor occurs, one or more of the following paths should be executed: explaining your expectations, touring the office. 
Once explaining your expectations occurs, holding a welcoming ceremony should be done. 
Afterwards, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: explaining expectations for the following month and checking the paperwork. 
Once explaining expectations for the following month occurs, you need to get approval.
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then one or more of the following paths should be executed: encouraging them to socially interact with the team, planning check-in meetings. 
Once planning check-in meetings occurs, one or more of the following paths should be executed: providing reading material for personal growth, explaining long-term goals. 
The process is now completed.
