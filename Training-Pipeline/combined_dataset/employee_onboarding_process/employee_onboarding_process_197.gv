The following text is about the employee onboarding process. It starts with making an introduction. 
After making an introduction, the next tasks should be preparing employee paperwork and providing a job description with responsibilities, they should be done in parallel. 
After providing a job description with responsibilities, preparing benefits package should be done. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then assigning a mentor should be done. 
Once assigning a mentor occurs, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: explaining expectations for the following month and getting approval. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then one or more of the following paths should be executed: encouraging them to socially interact with the team, planning check-in meetings. 
After encouraging them to socially interact with the team, one or more of the following paths should be executed: providing reading material for personal growth, explaining long-term goals.
