The following description is about the employee onboarding process. It begins when you make an introduction. 
Once making an introduction occurs, preparing employee's workstation should be done. 
When preparing employee's workstation is completed, holding a welcoming ceremony should be done. 
Once holding a welcoming ceremony occurs, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: getting approval and checking the paperwork. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then the process is split into 2 parallel branches: providing reading material for personal growth and explaining long-term goals. 
The process is now completed.
