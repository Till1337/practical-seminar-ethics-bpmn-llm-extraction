The following text is about the employee onboarding process. It begins when you make an introduction. 
After making an introduction, discussing role, goals and projects with supervisor needs to be done. 
When discussing role, goals and projects with supervisor is completed, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: assigning a mentor and explaining your expectations. 
After explaining your expectations, you need to assign training material.
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then assigning first project should be done. 
Once assigning first project occurs, encouraging them to socially interact with the team needs to be done. 
The process is now completed.
