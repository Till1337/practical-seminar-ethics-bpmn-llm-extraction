The following description is about the client onboarding process for a marketing agency. It begins when you send the contract to the client. 
When sending the contract to the client is completed, you need to research the campaign ideas.
After researching the campaign ideas, one or more of the following paths should be executed: assigning work to the team, informing client of project start. 
Afterwards, the next tasks should be having a follow-up call, sending a post-onboarding survey and making changes based on follow-up call, they should be done in parallel. 
The process is now completed.
