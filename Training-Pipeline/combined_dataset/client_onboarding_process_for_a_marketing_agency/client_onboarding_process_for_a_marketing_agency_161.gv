The text below is about the client onboarding process for a marketing agency. It starts with sending the contract to the client. 
Once sending the contract to the client occurs, one or more of the following paths should be executed: researching the campaign ideas, scheduling future calls. 
Then, assigning work to the team should be done. 
When assigning work to the team is completed, sending a post-onboarding survey should be done. 
The process is now completed.
