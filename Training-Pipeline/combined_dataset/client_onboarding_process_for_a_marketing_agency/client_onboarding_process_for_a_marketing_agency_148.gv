The following text is about the client onboarding process for a marketing agency. It starts with requesting marketing and media resources from the client. 
After requesting marketing and media resources from the client, the process is split into 3 parallel branches: updating client's CRM, confirming questionnaire is complete and scheduling future calls. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then the process is split into 2 parallel branches: assigning work to the team and informing client of project start. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then having a follow-up call should be done. 
The process is now completed.
