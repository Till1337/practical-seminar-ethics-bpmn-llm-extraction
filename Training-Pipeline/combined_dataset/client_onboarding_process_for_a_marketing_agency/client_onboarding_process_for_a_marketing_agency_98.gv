The following text is about the client onboarding process for a marketing agency. It starts with requesting marketing and media resources from the client. 
Once requesting marketing and media resources from the client occurs, one or more of the following paths should be executed: updating client's CRM, scheduling future calls. 
After updating client's CRM, the next tasks should be getting approval for the first draft and confirming questionnaire is complete, they should be done in parallel. 
Afterwards, you need to inform client of project start.
