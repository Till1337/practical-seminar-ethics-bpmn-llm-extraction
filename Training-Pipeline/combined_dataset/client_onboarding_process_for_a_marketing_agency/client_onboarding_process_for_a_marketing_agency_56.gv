The following text is about the client onboarding process for a marketing agency. It begins when you record basic details for the client. 
Once recording basic details for the client occurs, getting approval for the first draft should be done. 
After getting approval for the first draft, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: informing client of project start and assigning work to the team. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then the process is split into 2 parallel branches: sending a post-onboarding survey and making changes based on follow-up call. 
After making changes based on follow-up call, you need to have a follow-up call.
The process is now completed.
