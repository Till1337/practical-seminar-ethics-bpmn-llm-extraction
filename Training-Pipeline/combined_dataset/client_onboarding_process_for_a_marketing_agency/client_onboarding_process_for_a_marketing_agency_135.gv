The following description is about the client onboarding process for a marketing agency. It begins when you have an onboarding call with the client. 
Once having an onboarding call with the client occurs, getting approval for the first draft needs to be done. 
After getting approval for the first draft, the next tasks should be informing client of project start and assigning work to the team, they should be done in parallel. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then one or more of the following paths should be executed: sending a post-onboarding survey, making changes based on follow-up call. 
The process is now completed.
