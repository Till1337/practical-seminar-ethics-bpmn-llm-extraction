The text below is about the client onboarding process for a marketing agency. It starts with checking the signed documents. 
Once checking the signed documents occurs, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: creating first draft of the marketing plan  and scheduling future calls. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then one or more of the following paths should be executed: assigning work to the team, informing client of project start. 
Afterwards, one or more of the following paths should be executed: making changes based on follow-up call, having a follow-up call. 
Once making changes based on follow-up call occurs, you need to send a post-onboarding survey.
The process is now completed.
