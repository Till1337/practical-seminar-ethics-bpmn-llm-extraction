The following text is about the client onboarding process for a marketing agency. It starts with confirming the received marketing and media resources. 
When confirming the received marketing and media resources is completed, researching the campaign ideas should be done. 
After researching the campaign ideas, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: informing client of project start and assigning work to the team. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then you need to have a follow-up call.
The process is now completed.
