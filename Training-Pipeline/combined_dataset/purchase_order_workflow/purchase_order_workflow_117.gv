The following description is about the purchase order workflow. It starts with creating the purchase requisition. 
After creating the purchase requisition, you need to get approval from finance team.
Once getting approval from finance team occurs, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: informing the supplier the order is ready for approval and creating the purchase order. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then you need to get approval from supplier.
Once getting approval from supplier occurs, you need to confirm the delivery date.
The process is now completed.
