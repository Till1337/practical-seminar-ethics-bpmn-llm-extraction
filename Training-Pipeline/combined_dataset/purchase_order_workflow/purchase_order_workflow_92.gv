The text below is about the purchase order workflow. It starts with creating the purchase requisition. 
When creating the purchase requisition is completed, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: getting approval from finance team and getting approval from manager. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then informing the supplier the order is ready for approval should be done. 
After informing the supplier the order is ready for approval, getting approval from supplier should be done. 
After getting approval from supplier, you need to send details to the department.
The process is now completed.
