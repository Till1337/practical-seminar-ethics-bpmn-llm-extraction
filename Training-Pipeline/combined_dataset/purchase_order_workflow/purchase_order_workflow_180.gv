The following description is about the purchase order workflow. It starts with recording the basic details. 
After recording the basic details, you need to get approval from manager.
When getting approval from manager is completed, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: informing the supplier the order is ready for approval and creating the purchase order. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then you need to get approval from supplier.
Once getting approval from supplier occurs, sending details to the department should be done. 
The process is now completed.
