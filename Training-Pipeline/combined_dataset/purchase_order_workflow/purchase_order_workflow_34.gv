The following description is about the purchase order workflow. It begins when you record the basic details. 
After recording the basic details, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: getting approval from finance team and getting approval from manager. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then creating the purchase order should be done. 
After creating the purchase order, getting approval from supplier needs to be done. 
After getting approval from supplier, the next tasks should be sending details to the department and filing the purchase order, they should be done in parallel. 
The process is now completed.
