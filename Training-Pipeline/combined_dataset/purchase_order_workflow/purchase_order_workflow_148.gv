The text below is about the purchase order workflow. It begins when you record the basic details. 
After recording the basic details, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: getting approval from finance team and getting approval from manager. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then you need to create the purchase order.
When creating the purchase order is completed, getting approval from supplier needs to be done. 
After getting approval from supplier, the process is split into 3 parallel branches: filing the purchase order, recording the purchase order and sending details to the department. 
The process is now completed.
