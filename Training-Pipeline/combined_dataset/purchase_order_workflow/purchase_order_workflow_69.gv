The text below is about the purchase order workflow. It starts with recording the basic details. 
When recording the basic details is completed, the next tasks should be getting approval from finance team and getting approval from manager, they should be done in parallel. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then informing the supplier the order is ready for approval should be done. 
Once informing the supplier the order is ready for approval occurs, getting approval from supplier should be done. 
When getting approval from supplier is completed, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: confirming the delivery date and recording the purchase order. 
The process is now completed.
