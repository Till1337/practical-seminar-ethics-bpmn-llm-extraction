The following text is about the purchase order workflow. It begins when you create the purchase requisition. 
After creating the purchase requisition, one or more of the following paths should be executed: getting approval from manager, getting approval from finance team. 
Then, one or more of the following paths should be executed: creating the purchase order, informing the supplier the order is ready for approval. 
Afterwards, you need to get approval from supplier.
Once getting approval from supplier occurs, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: confirming the delivery date and sending details to the department. 
The process is now completed.
