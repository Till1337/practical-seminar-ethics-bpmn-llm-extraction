The following description is about the purchase order workflow. It begins when you record the basic details. 
Once recording the basic details occurs, the next tasks should be getting approval from finance team and getting approval from manager, they should be done in parallel. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then the process is split into 2 parallel branches: informing the supplier the order is ready for approval and creating the purchase order. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then getting approval from supplier should be done. 
Once getting approval from supplier occurs, filing the purchase order should be done. 
The process is now completed.
