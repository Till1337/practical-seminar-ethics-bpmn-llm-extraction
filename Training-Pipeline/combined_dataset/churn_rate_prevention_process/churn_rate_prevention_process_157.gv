The following text is about the churn rate prevention process. It begins when you record basic details. 
Once recording basic details occurs, the next tasks should be determining ways to increase value, identifying key points of value and analyzing how they use your product, they should be done in parallel. 
Once identifying key points of value occurs, you need to quantify the impact of cancellation.
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then confirming call date and time should be done. 
After confirming call date and time, summarizing why they want to leave needs to be done. 
When summarizing why they want to leave is completed, one or more of the following paths should be executed: informing them of key metrics demonstrating value, describing your ideas to increase value. 
Then, you need to record the customer’s decision.
When recording the customer’s decision is completed, you need to ask if they have any other concerns.
After asking if they have any other concerns, you need to send learnings to appropriate managers.
The process is now completed.
