The following description is about the churn rate prevention process. It begins when you record basic details. 
Once recording basic details occurs, analyzing how they use your product should be done. 
Once analyzing how they use your product occurs, you need to confirm call date and time.
After confirming call date and time, the process is split into 3 parallel branches: asking open-ended questions, identifying the root cause(s) of the problem and summarizing why they want to leave. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then describing your ideas to increase value should be done. 
When describing your ideas to increase value is completed, one or more of the following paths should be executed: thanking them for their time and feedback, recording the customer’s decision. 
After that, asking if they have any other concerns should be done. 
Once asking if they have any other concerns occurs, you need to send learnings to appropriate managers.
The process is now completed.
