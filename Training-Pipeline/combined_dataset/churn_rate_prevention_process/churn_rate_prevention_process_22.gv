The text below is about the churn rate prevention process. It begins when you record basic details. 
Once recording basic details occurs, one or more of the following paths should be executed: identifying key points of value, analyzing how they use your product. 
After identifying key points of value, you need to determine ways to increase value.
Afterwards, one or more of the following paths should be executed: confirming call date and time, recording if they are willing to talk. 
Once recording if they are willing to talk occurs, sending them an email needs to be done. 
After that, asking open-ended questions should be done. 
Once asking open-ended questions occurs, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: presenting them with a special offer and describing your ideas to increase value. 
When presenting them with a special offer is completed, informing them of key metrics demonstrating value should be done. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then the next tasks should be thanking them for their time and feedback and recording the customer’s decision, they should be done in parallel. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then asking if they have any other concerns needs to be done. 
When asking if they have any other concerns is completed, one or more of the following paths should be executed: sending learnings to appropriate managers, noting down important learnings from the conversation. 
The process is now completed.
