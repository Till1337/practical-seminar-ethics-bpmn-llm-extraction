The following description is about the churn rate prevention process. It begins when you record basic details. 
When recording basic details is completed, one or more of the following paths should be executed: analyzing how they use your product, identifying key points of value. 
Afterwards, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: recording whether or not the customer responded and giving them a call. 
When giving them a call is completed, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: recording if they are willing to talk and confirming call date and time. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then the next tasks should be asking open-ended questions and identifying the root cause(s) of the problem, they should be done in parallel. 
Once identifying the root cause(s) of the problem occurs, you need to summarize why they want to leave.
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then presenting them with a special offer needs to be done. 
Once presenting them with a special offer occurs, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: thanking them for their time and feedback and recording the customer’s decision. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then asking if they have any other concerns needs to be done. 
After asking if they have any other concerns, sending learnings to appropriate managers needs to be done. 
The process is now completed.
