The following text is about the churn rate prevention process. It starts with recording basic details. 
After recording basic details, one or more of the following paths should be executed: determining ways to increase value, quantifying the impact of cancellation. 
Afterwards, the next tasks should be recording whether or not the customer responded and giving them a call, they should be done in parallel. 
After giving them a call, one or more of the following paths should be executed: recording if they are willing to talk, confirming call date and time. 
After recording if they are willing to talk, sending them an email should be done. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then one or more of the following paths should be executed: identifying the root cause(s) of the problem, asking open-ended questions. 
When asking open-ended questions is completed, you need to summarize why they want to leave.
Then, one or more of the following paths should be executed: informing them of key metrics demonstrating value, describing your ideas to increase value. 
Then, you need to thank them for their time and feedback.
After thanking them for their time and feedback, asking if they have any other concerns should be done. 
Once asking if they have any other concerns occurs, noting down important learnings from the conversation needs to be done. 
The process is now completed.
