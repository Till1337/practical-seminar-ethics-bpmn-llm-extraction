The following description is about the churn rate prevention process. It begins when you record basic details. 
Once recording basic details occurs, you need to identify key points of value.
After identifying key points of value, the next tasks should be recording if they are willing to talk, giving them a call and sending them an email, they should be done in parallel. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then you need to summarize why they want to leave.
When summarizing why they want to leave is completed, one or more of the following paths should be executed: presenting them with a special offer, describing your ideas to increase value. 
After describing your ideas to increase value, informing them of key metrics demonstrating value needs to be done. 
After that, one or more of the following paths should be executed: recording the customer’s decision, thanking them for their time and feedback. 
Afterwards, asking if they have any other concerns needs to be done. 
Once asking if they have any other concerns occurs, sending learnings to appropriate managers needs to be done. 
The process is now completed.
