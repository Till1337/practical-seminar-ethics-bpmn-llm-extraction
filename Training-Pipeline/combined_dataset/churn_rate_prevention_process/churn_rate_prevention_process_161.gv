The text below is about the churn rate prevention process. It starts with recording basic details. 
When recording basic details is completed, you need to determine ways to increase value.
When determining ways to increase value is completed, confirming call date and time needs to be done. 
After confirming call date and time, one or more of the following paths should be executed: identifying the root cause(s) of the problem, summarizing why they want to leave. 
Once summarizing why they want to leave occurs, asking open-ended questions should be done. 
Then, presenting them with a special offer should be done. 
When presenting them with a special offer is completed, the next tasks should be thanking them for their time and feedback and recording the customer’s decision, they should be done in parallel. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then asking if they have any other concerns needs to be done. 
When asking if they have any other concerns is completed, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: noting down important learnings from the conversation and sending learnings to appropriate managers. 
The process is now completed.
