The text below is about the churn rate prevention process. It starts with recording basic details. 
After recording basic details, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: quantifying the impact of cancellation and analyzing how they use your product. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then you need to confirm call date and time.
Once confirming call date and time occurs, you need to ask open-ended questions.
When asking open-ended questions is completed, describing your ideas to increase value needs to be done. 
After describing your ideas to increase value, one or more of the following paths should be executed: thanking them for their time and feedback, recording the customer’s decision. 
After that, asking if they have any other concerns should be done. 
After asking if they have any other concerns, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: noting down important learnings from the conversation and sending learnings to appropriate managers. 
The process is now completed.
