The following text is about the churn rate prevention process. It starts with recording basic details. 
When recording basic details is completed, determining ways to increase value should be done. 
When determining ways to increase value is completed, the next tasks should be recording if they are willing to talk, sending them an email and giving them a call, they should be done in parallel. 
When giving them a call is completed, confirming call date and time should be done. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then summarizing why they want to leave should be done. 
When summarizing why they want to leave is completed, informing them of key metrics demonstrating value should be done. 
After informing them of key metrics demonstrating value, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: thanking them for their time and feedback and recording the customer’s decision. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then you need to ask if they have any other concerns.
When asking if they have any other concerns is completed, one or more of the following paths should be executed: noting down important learnings from the conversation, sending learnings to appropriate managers. 
The process is now completed.
