The following text is about the churn rate prevention process. It begins when you record basic details. 
When recording basic details is completed, you need to identify key points of value.
When identifying key points of value is completed, recording whether or not the customer responded should be done. 
Once recording whether or not the customer responded occurs, you need to summarize why they want to leave.
When summarizing why they want to leave is completed, the next tasks should be informing them of key metrics demonstrating value and describing your ideas to increase value, they should be done in parallel. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then one or more of the following paths should be executed: recording the customer’s decision, thanking them for their time and feedback. 
Then, asking if they have any other concerns needs to be done. 
When asking if they have any other concerns is completed, sending learnings to appropriate managers needs to be done. 
The process is now completed.
