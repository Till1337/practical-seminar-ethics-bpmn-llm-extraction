The following text is about the churn rate prevention process. It begins when you record basic details. 
When recording basic details is completed, quantifying the impact of cancellation should be done. 
After quantifying the impact of cancellation, one or more of the following paths should be executed: sending them an email, confirming call date and time. 
After that, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: asking open-ended questions and summarizing why they want to leave. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then the process is split into 2 parallel branches: presenting them with a special offer and informing them of key metrics demonstrating value. 
Once presenting them with a special offer occurs, describing your ideas to increase value should be done. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then one or more of the following paths should be executed: thanking them for their time and feedback, recording the customer’s decision. 
Afterwards, asking if they have any other concerns needs to be done. 
When asking if they have any other concerns is completed, noting down important learnings from the conversation should be done. 
The process is now completed.
