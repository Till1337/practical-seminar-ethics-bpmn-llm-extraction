The following description is about the churn rate prevention process. It starts with recording basic details. 
When recording basic details is completed, one or more of the following paths should be executed: determining ways to increase value, identifying key points of value. 
After determining ways to increase value, analyzing how they use your product should be done. 
After identifying key points of value, quantifying the impact of cancellation needs to be done. 
Then, recording if they are willing to talk needs to be done. 
When recording if they are willing to talk is completed, identifying the root cause(s) of the problem should be done. 
After identifying the root cause(s) of the problem, one or more of the following paths should be executed: describing your ideas to increase value, presenting them with a special offer, informing them of key metrics demonstrating value. 
Afterwards, thanking them for their time and feedback needs to be done. 
After thanking them for their time and feedback, you need to ask if they have any other concerns.
When asking if they have any other concerns is completed, you need to note down important learnings from the conversation.
The process is now completed.
