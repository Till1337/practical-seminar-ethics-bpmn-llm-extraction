The following description is about the churn rate prevention process. It starts with recording basic details. 
After recording basic details, determining ways to increase value needs to be done. 
Once determining ways to increase value occurs, giving them a call needs to be done. 
After giving them a call, identifying the root cause(s) of the problem should be done. 
After identifying the root cause(s) of the problem, one or more of the following paths should be executed: presenting them with a special offer, describing your ideas to increase value. 
After describing your ideas to increase value, informing them of key metrics demonstrating value should be done. 
Then, you need to record the customer’s decision.
When recording the customer’s decision is completed, asking if they have any other concerns should be done. 
After asking if they have any other concerns, one or more of the following paths should be executed: noting down important learnings from the conversation, sending learnings to appropriate managers. 
The process is now completed.
