The text below is about the churn rate prevention process. It starts with recording basic details. 
Once recording basic details occurs, identifying key points of value needs to be done. 
After identifying key points of value, recording whether or not the customer responded should be done. 
When recording whether or not the customer responded is completed, you need to identify the root cause(s) of the problem.
Once identifying the root cause(s) of the problem occurs, one or more of the following paths should be executed: informing them of key metrics demonstrating value, presenting them with a special offer, describing your ideas to increase value. 
Afterwards, the next tasks should be recording the customer’s decision and thanking them for their time and feedback, they should be done in parallel. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then asking if they have any other concerns needs to be done. 
Once asking if they have any other concerns occurs, one or more of the following paths should be executed: noting down important learnings from the conversation, sending learnings to appropriate managers. 
The process is now completed.
