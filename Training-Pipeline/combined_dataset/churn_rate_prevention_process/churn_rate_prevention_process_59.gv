The following description is about the churn rate prevention process. It starts with recording basic details. 
After recording basic details, analyzing how they use your product should be done. 
After analyzing how they use your product, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: confirming call date and time and recording whether or not the customer responded. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then summarizing why they want to leave needs to be done. 
After summarizing why they want to leave, one or more of the following paths should be executed: presenting them with a special offer, informing them of key metrics demonstrating value. 
When presenting them with a special offer is completed, describing your ideas to increase value should be done. 
After that, the next tasks should be thanking them for their time and feedback and recording the customer’s decision, they should be done in parallel. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then you need to ask if they have any other concerns.
After asking if they have any other concerns, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: noting down important learnings from the conversation and sending learnings to appropriate managers. 
The process is now completed.
