The following text is about the churn rate prevention process. It begins when you record basic details. 
Once recording basic details occurs, one or more of the following paths should be executed: analyzing how they use your product, quantifying the impact of cancellation. 
When analyzing how they use your product is completed, you need to identify key points of value.
When quantifying the impact of cancellation is completed, you need to determine ways to increase value.
Then, one or more of the following paths should be executed: confirming call date and time, recording whether or not the customer responded. 
Then, identifying the root cause(s) of the problem should be done. 
After identifying the root cause(s) of the problem, informing them of key metrics demonstrating value should be done. 
After informing them of key metrics demonstrating value, one or more of the following paths should be executed: recording the customer’s decision, thanking them for their time and feedback. 
Then, you need to ask if they have any other concerns.
When asking if they have any other concerns is completed, noting down important learnings from the conversation needs to be done. 
The process is now completed.
