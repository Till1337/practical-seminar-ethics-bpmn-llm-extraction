The following text is about the churn rate prevention process. It starts with recording basic details. 
After recording basic details, you need to analyze how they use your product.
After analyzing how they use your product, one or more of the following paths should be executed: giving them a call, sending them an email, recording if they are willing to talk. 
After giving them a call, recording whether or not the customer responded needs to be done. 
Then, summarizing why they want to leave needs to be done. 
After summarizing why they want to leave, one or more of the following paths should be executed: informing them of key metrics demonstrating value, describing your ideas to increase value. 
Afterwards, recording the customer’s decision needs to be done. 
When recording the customer’s decision is completed, you need to ask if they have any other concerns.
After asking if they have any other concerns, the next tasks should be sending learnings to appropriate managers and noting down important learnings from the conversation, they should be done in parallel. 
The process is now completed.
