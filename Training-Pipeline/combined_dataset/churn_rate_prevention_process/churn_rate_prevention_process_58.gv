The following description is about the churn rate prevention process. It starts with recording basic details. 
Once recording basic details occurs, determining ways to increase value should be done. 
After determining ways to increase value, the next tasks should be recording whether or not the customer responded and recording if they are willing to talk, they should be done in parallel. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then identifying the root cause(s) of the problem needs to be done. 
Once identifying the root cause(s) of the problem occurs, presenting them with a special offer needs to be done. 
After presenting them with a special offer, recording the customer’s decision should be done. 
Once recording the customer’s decision occurs, asking if they have any other concerns needs to be done. 
Once asking if they have any other concerns occurs, sending learnings to appropriate managers needs to be done. 
The process is now completed.
