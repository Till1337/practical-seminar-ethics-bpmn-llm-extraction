The following text is about the churn rate prevention process. It starts with recording basic details. 
Once recording basic details occurs, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: analyzing how they use your product and quantifying the impact of cancellation. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then the process is split into 2 parallel branches: confirming call date and time and recording if they are willing to talk. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then asking open-ended questions should be done. 
After asking open-ended questions, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: describing your ideas to increase value and presenting them with a special offer. 
Once presenting them with a special offer occurs, informing them of key metrics demonstrating value should be done. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then recording the customer’s decision needs to be done. 
Once recording the customer’s decision occurs, asking if they have any other concerns should be done. 
When asking if they have any other concerns is completed, you need to note down important learnings from the conversation.
The process is now completed.
