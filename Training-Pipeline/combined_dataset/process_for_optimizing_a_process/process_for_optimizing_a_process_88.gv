The following text is about the process for optimizing a process. It starts with confirming the basic information. 
After confirming the basic information, one or more of the following paths should be executed: identifying the process's components, assessing the performance of the process. 
Afterwards, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: defining how long it takes to complete the process and considering where bottlenecks occur. 
When considering where bottlenecks occur is completed, assessing if any steps are confusing should be done. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then writing the potential process improvements needs to be done. 
Once writing the potential process improvements occurs, you need to get approval for processing improvements.
Once getting approval for processing improvements occurs, using the updated process needs to be done. 
When using the updated process is completed, the next tasks should be communicating the process changes and scheduling the next process review and optimization, they should be done in parallel. 
The process is now completed.
