The following text is about the process for optimizing a process. It starts with confirming the basic information. 
When confirming the basic information is completed, one or more of the following paths should be executed: assessing the performance of the process, identifying the process's components. 
When identifying the process's components is completed, confirming if the process requires optimization needs to be done. 
Afterwards, you need to note which steps can be automated.
Once noting which steps can be automated occurs, you need to write the potential process improvements.
After writing the potential process improvements, you need to get approval for processing improvements.
After getting approval for processing improvements, one or more of the following paths should be executed: adding feedback on the updated process, using the updated process. 
Afterwards, communicating the process changes should be done. 
The process is now completed.
