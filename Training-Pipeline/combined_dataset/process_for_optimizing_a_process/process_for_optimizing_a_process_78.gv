The following description is about the process for optimizing a process. It starts with confirming the basic information. 
When confirming the basic information is completed, assessing the performance of the process needs to be done. 
When assessing the performance of the process is completed, considering where bottlenecks occur needs to be done. 
After considering where bottlenecks occur, you need to write the potential process improvements.
After writing the potential process improvements, getting approval for processing improvements should be done. 
When getting approval for processing improvements is completed, one or more of the following paths should be executed: updating the process documents, defining what would make the improvements successful. 
Afterwards, you need to communicate the process changes.
The process is now completed.
