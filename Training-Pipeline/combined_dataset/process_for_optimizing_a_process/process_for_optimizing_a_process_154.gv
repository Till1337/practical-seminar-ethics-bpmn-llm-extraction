The following text is about the process for optimizing a process. It begins when you confirm the basic information. 
When confirming the basic information is completed, one or more of the following paths should be executed: assessing the performance of the process, identifying the process's components. 
Then, assessing if any steps are confusing should be done. 
After assessing if any steps are confusing, writing the potential process improvements should be done. 
When writing the potential process improvements is completed, getting approval for processing improvements needs to be done. 
After getting approval for processing improvements, defining what would make the improvements successful should be done. 
After defining what would make the improvements successful, you need to determine how the process will be monitored.
The process is now completed.
