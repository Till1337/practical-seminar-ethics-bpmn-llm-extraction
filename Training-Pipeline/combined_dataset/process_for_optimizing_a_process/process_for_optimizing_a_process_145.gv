The following text is about the process for optimizing a process. It starts with confirming the basic information. 
When confirming the basic information is completed, confirming if the process requires optimization needs to be done. 
When confirming if the process requires optimization is completed, one or more of the following paths should be executed: examining potentially wasteful steps, noting which steps can be automated. 
Afterwards, writing the potential process improvements should be done. 
Once writing the potential process improvements occurs, you need to get approval for processing improvements.
When getting approval for processing improvements is completed, you need to determine what improvements should go forward.
Once determining what improvements should go forward occurs, communicating the process changes needs to be done. 
The process is now completed.
