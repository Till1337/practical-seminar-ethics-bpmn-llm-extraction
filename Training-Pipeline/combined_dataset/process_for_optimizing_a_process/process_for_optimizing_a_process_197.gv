The following description is about the process for optimizing a process. It begins when you confirm the basic information. 
When confirming the basic information is completed, confirming if the process requires optimization should be done. 
Once confirming if the process requires optimization occurs, you need to examine potentially wasteful steps.
When examining potentially wasteful steps is completed, writing the potential process improvements needs to be done. 
When writing the potential process improvements is completed, you need to get approval for processing improvements.
After getting approval for processing improvements, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: updating the process documents and using the updated process. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then scheduling the next process review and optimization needs to be done. 
The process is now completed.
