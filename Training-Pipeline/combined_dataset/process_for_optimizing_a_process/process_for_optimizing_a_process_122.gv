The following text is about the process for optimizing a process. It begins when you confirm the basic information. 
Once confirming the basic information occurs, one or more of the following paths should be executed: assessing the performance of the process, identifying the process's components. 
Afterwards, one or more of the following paths should be executed: looking to see if the process can be simplified, noting which steps can be automated. 
Afterwards, you need to write the potential process improvements.
After writing the potential process improvements, getting approval for processing improvements needs to be done. 
After getting approval for processing improvements, choosing who will test the updated process needs to be done. 
After choosing who will test the updated process, implementing the process changes needs to be done. 
The process is now completed.
