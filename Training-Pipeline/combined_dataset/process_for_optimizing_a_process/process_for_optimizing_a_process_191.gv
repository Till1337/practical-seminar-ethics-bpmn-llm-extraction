The following text is about the process for optimizing a process. It begins when you confirm the basic information. 
Once confirming the basic information occurs, one or more of the following paths should be executed: assessing the performance of the process, confirming if the process requires optimization, identifying the process's components. 
After that, assessing if any steps are confusing needs to be done. 
Once assessing if any steps are confusing occurs, you need to write the potential process improvements.
Once writing the potential process improvements occurs, you need to get approval for processing improvements.
After getting approval for processing improvements, the next tasks should be defining what would make the improvements successful and updating the process documents, they should be done in parallel. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then determining how the process will be monitored should be done. 
The process is now completed.
