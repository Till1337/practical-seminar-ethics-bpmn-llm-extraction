The following description is about the process for optimizing a process. It begins when you confirm the basic information. 
When confirming the basic information is completed, the next tasks should be identifying the process's components and assessing the performance of the process, they should be done in parallel. 
Once assessing the performance of the process occurs, confirming if the process requires optimization needs to be done. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then defining how long it takes to complete the process needs to be done. 
When defining how long it takes to complete the process is completed, you need to write the potential process improvements.
When writing the potential process improvements is completed, getting approval for processing improvements needs to be done. 
When getting approval for processing improvements is completed, you need to define what would make the improvements successful.
Once defining what would make the improvements successful occurs, implementing the process changes needs to be done. 
The process is now completed.
