The following description is about the process for optimizing a process. It starts with confirming the basic information. 
Once confirming the basic information occurs, confirming if the process requires optimization needs to be done. 
After confirming if the process requires optimization, one or more of the following paths should be executed: defining how long it takes to complete the process, examining potentially wasteful steps. 
Once defining how long it takes to complete the process occurs, you need to consider where bottlenecks occur.
Then, writing the potential process improvements should be done. 
Once writing the potential process improvements occurs, getting approval for processing improvements needs to be done. 
After getting approval for processing improvements, the next tasks should be adding feedback on the updated process and using the updated process, they should be done in parallel. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then you need to communicate the process changes.
The process is now completed.
