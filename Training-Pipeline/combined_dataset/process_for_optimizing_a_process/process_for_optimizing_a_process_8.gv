The following text is about the process for optimizing a process. It begins when you confirm the basic information. 
Once confirming the basic information occurs, identifying the process's components should be done. 
When identifying the process's components is completed, looking to see if the process can be simplified needs to be done. 
After looking to see if the process can be simplified, writing the potential process improvements should be done. 
After writing the potential process improvements, you need to get approval for processing improvements.
Once getting approval for processing improvements occurs, using the updated process should be done. 
After using the updated process, the next tasks should be implementing the process changes and communicating the process changes, they should be done in parallel. 
Once communicating the process changes occurs, the next tasks should be scheduling the next process review and optimization and determining how the process will be monitored, they should be done in parallel. 
The process is now completed.
