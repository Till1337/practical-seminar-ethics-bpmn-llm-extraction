The following text is about the process for optimizing a process. It begins when you confirm the basic information. 
When confirming the basic information is completed, assessing the performance of the process should be done. 
When assessing the performance of the process is completed, the next tasks should be considering where bottlenecks occur and examining potentially wasteful steps, they should be done in parallel. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then you need to write the potential process improvements.
Once writing the potential process improvements occurs, you need to get approval for processing improvements.
Once getting approval for processing improvements occurs, defining what would make the improvements successful should be done. 
Once defining what would make the improvements successful occurs, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: communicating the process changes and implementing the process changes. 
The process is now completed.
