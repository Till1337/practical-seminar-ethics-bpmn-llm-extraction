The following text is about the process for optimizing a process. It starts with confirming the basic information. 
Once confirming the basic information occurs, the next tasks should be assessing the performance of the process and confirming if the process requires optimization, they should be done in parallel. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then you need to note which steps can be automated.
Once noting which steps can be automated occurs, writing the potential process improvements should be done. 
When writing the potential process improvements is completed, getting approval for processing improvements needs to be done. 
When getting approval for processing improvements is completed, one or more of the following paths should be executed: using the updated process, updating the process documents. 
Afterwards, one or more of the following paths should be executed: communicating the process changes, implementing the process changes. 
When communicating the process changes is completed, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: scheduling the next process review and optimization and determining how the process will be monitored. 
The process is now completed.
