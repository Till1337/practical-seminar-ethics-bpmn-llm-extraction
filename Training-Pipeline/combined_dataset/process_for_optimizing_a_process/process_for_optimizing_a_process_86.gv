The following description is about the process for optimizing a process. It begins when you confirm the basic information. 
Once confirming the basic information occurs, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: identifying the process's components and assessing the performance of the process. 
When assessing the performance of the process is completed, you need to confirm if the process requires optimization.
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then you need to look to see if the process can be simplified.
When looking to see if the process can be simplified is completed, writing the potential process improvements should be done. 
When writing the potential process improvements is completed, getting approval for processing improvements should be done. 
After getting approval for processing improvements, defining what would make the improvements successful needs to be done. 
After defining what would make the improvements successful, determining how the process will be monitored should be done. 
The process is now completed.
