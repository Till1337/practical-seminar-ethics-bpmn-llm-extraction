The following description is about the process for optimizing a process. It begins when you confirm the basic information. 
Once confirming the basic information occurs, assessing the performance of the process should be done. 
After assessing the performance of the process, one or more of the following paths should be executed: assessing if any steps are confusing, defining how long it takes to complete the process. 
Then, writing the potential process improvements needs to be done. 
Once writing the potential process improvements occurs, getting approval for processing improvements needs to be done. 
When getting approval for processing improvements is completed, adding feedback on the updated process needs to be done. 
Once adding feedback on the updated process occurs, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: implementing the process changes and determining how the process will be monitored. 
The process is now completed.
