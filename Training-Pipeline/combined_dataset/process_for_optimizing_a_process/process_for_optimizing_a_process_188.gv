The following text is about the process for optimizing a process. It starts with confirming the basic information. 
After confirming the basic information, the next tasks should be confirming if the process requires optimization and identifying the process's components, they should be done in parallel. 
Once confirming if the process requires optimization occurs, you need to assess the performance of the process.
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then defining how long it takes to complete the process needs to be done. 
When defining how long it takes to complete the process is completed, writing the potential process improvements needs to be done. 
When writing the potential process improvements is completed, you need to get approval for processing improvements.
When getting approval for processing improvements is completed, using the updated process needs to be done. 
Once using the updated process occurs, one or more of the following paths should be executed: communicating the process changes, implementing the process changes, scheduling the next process review and optimization. 
The process is now completed.
