The following description is about the process for optimizing a process. It begins when you confirm the basic information. 
After confirming the basic information, one or more of the following paths should be executed: confirming if the process requires optimization, identifying the process's components, assessing the performance of the process. 
Then, one or more of the following paths should be executed: looking to see if the process can be simplified, examining potentially wasteful steps. 
Once looking to see if the process can be simplified occurs, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: considering where bottlenecks occur and defining how long it takes to complete the process. 
When considering where bottlenecks occur is completed, you need to note which steps can be automated.
After examining potentially wasteful steps, assessing if any steps are confusing needs to be done. 
Afterwards, you need to write the potential process improvements.
After writing the potential process improvements, getting approval for processing improvements needs to be done. 
Once getting approval for processing improvements occurs, updating the process documents needs to be done. 
After updating the process documents, the next tasks should be scheduling the next process review and optimization and implementing the process changes, they should be done in parallel. 
The process is now completed.
