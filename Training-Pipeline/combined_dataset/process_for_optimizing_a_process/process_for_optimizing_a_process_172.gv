The following text is about the process for optimizing a process. It starts with confirming the basic information. 
When confirming the basic information is completed, one or more of the following paths should be executed: confirming if the process requires optimization, assessing the performance of the process. 
When confirming if the process requires optimization is completed, you need to identify the process's components.
After that, one or more of the following paths should be executed: considering where bottlenecks occur, noting which steps can be automated. 
Then, writing the potential process improvements should be done. 
When writing the potential process improvements is completed, getting approval for processing improvements should be done. 
When getting approval for processing improvements is completed, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: determining what improvements should go forward and updating the process documents. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then the next tasks should be implementing the process changes, communicating the process changes and scheduling the next process review and optimization, they should be done in parallel. 
The process is now completed.
