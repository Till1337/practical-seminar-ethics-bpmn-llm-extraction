The following text is about the process for optimizing a process. It begins when you confirm the basic information. 
When confirming the basic information is completed, one or more of the following paths should be executed: identifying the process's components, assessing the performance of the process. 
After that, one or more of the following paths should be executed: assessing if any steps are confusing, considering where bottlenecks occur. 
After that, you need to write the potential process improvements.
Once writing the potential process improvements occurs, getting approval for processing improvements should be done. 
After getting approval for processing improvements, you need to choose who will test the updated process.
After choosing who will test the updated process, you need to implement the process changes.
The process is now completed.
