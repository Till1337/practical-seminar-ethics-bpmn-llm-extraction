The text below is about the final grades submission process. It starts with unmuting all gradebook columns. 
Once unmuting all gradebook columns occurs, importing gradebook needs to be done. 
Once importing gradebook occurs, reviewing grades summary should be done. 
Once reviewing grades summary occurs, recalculating the grades should be done. 
Once recalculating the grades occurs, one or more of the following paths should be executed: submitting results to SSO, sending examiners grade approval sheet. 
The process is now completed.
