The following description is about the final grades submission process. It starts with entering results in the canvas gradebook. 
Once entering results in the canvas gradebook occurs, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: selecting exam assignment and applying score criteria. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then the process is split into 2 parallel branches: applying any changes and reviewing grades summary. 
After reviewing grades summary, reviewing course summary should be done. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then you need to export the final grades.
After exporting the final grades, you need to send examiners grade approval sheet.
The process is now completed.
