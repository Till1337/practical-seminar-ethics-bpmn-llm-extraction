The following description is about the final grades submission process. It starts with ensuring 'EX' or zero marks are applied as need. 
When ensuring 'EX' or zero marks are applied as need is completed, one or more of the following paths should be executed: importing gradebook, applying special grades to individuals. 
Afterwards, applying any changes needs to be done. 
When applying any changes is completed, one or more of the following paths should be executed: exporting the final grades, recalculating the grades. 
After that, getting approval signatures by the course director should be done. 
The process is now completed.
