The following text is about the final grades submission process. It starts with entering results in the canvas gradebook. 
After entering results in the canvas gradebook, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: importing gradebook and selecting exam assignment. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then you need to apply any changes.
After applying any changes, recalculating the grades should be done. 
After recalculating the grades, you need to send examiners grade approval sheet.
The process is now completed.
