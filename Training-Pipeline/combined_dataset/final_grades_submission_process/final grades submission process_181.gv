The text below is about the final grades submission process. It starts with unmuting all gradebook columns. 
When unmuting all gradebook columns is completed, you need to calculate the grades.
Once calculating the grades occurs, reviewing course summary needs to be done. 
Once reviewing course summary occurs, one or more of the following paths should be executed: exporting the course summary, exporting the final grades. 
After exporting the final grades, you need to recalculate the grades.
Then, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: sending examiners grade approval sheet and submitting results to SSO. 
The process is now completed.
