The following description is about the final grades submission process. It starts with entering results in the canvas gradebook. 
When entering results in the canvas gradebook is completed, you need to prepare grades for SSO.
Once preparing grades for SSO occurs, the next tasks should be reviewing grades summary and applying any changes, they should be done in parallel. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then the next tasks should be exporting the course summary, exporting the final grades and recalculating the grades, they should be done in parallel. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then the process is split into 3 parallel branches: submitting results to SSO, sending examiners grade approval sheet and getting approval signatures by the course director. 
The process is now completed.
