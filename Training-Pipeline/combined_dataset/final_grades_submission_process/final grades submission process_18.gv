The following text is about the final grades submission process. It begins when you enter results in the canvas gradebook. 
Once entering results in the canvas gradebook occurs, selecting exam assignment needs to be done. 
When selecting exam assignment is completed, one or more of the following paths should be executed: reviewing grades summary, reviewing course summary, applying any changes. 
Afterwards, the next tasks should be exporting the final grades, exporting the course summary and recalculating the grades, they should be done in parallel. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then sending examiners grade approval sheet should be done. 
The process is now completed.
