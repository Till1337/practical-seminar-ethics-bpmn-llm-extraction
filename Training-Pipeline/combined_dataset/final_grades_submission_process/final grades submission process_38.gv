The following description is about the final grades submission process. It begins when you enter results in the canvas gradebook. 
After entering results in the canvas gradebook, the process is split into 3 parallel branches: importing gradebook, calculating the grades and applying special grades to individuals. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then the process is split into 3 parallel branches: reviewing grades summary, applying any changes and reviewing course summary. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then the next tasks should be exporting the course summary and recalculating the grades, they should be done in parallel. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then you need to get approval signatures by the course director.
The process is now completed.
