The following description is about the final grades submission process. It begins when you seek pre-approval of final grades. 
Once seeking pre-approval of final grades occurs, the process is split into 3 parallel branches: preparing grades for SSO, applying special grades to individuals and calculating the grades. 
After applying special grades to individuals, you need to import gradebook.
Once calculating the grades occurs, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: selecting exam assignment and applying score criteria. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then reviewing grades summary needs to be done. 
After reviewing grades summary, exporting the final grades should be done. 
After exporting the final grades, getting approval signatures by the course director should be done. 
The process is now completed.
