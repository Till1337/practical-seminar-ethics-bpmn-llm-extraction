The following text is about the final grades submission process. It starts with ensuring 'EX' or zero marks are applied as need. 
After ensuring 'EX' or zero marks are applied as need, selecting exam assignment needs to be done. 
When selecting exam assignment is completed, applying any changes should be done. 
Once applying any changes occurs, exporting the final grades needs to be done. 
When exporting the final grades is completed, you need to get approval signatures by the course director.
The process is now completed.
