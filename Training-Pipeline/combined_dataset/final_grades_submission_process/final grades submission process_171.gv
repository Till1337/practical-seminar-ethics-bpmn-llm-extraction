The following description is about the final grades submission process. It starts with entering results in the canvas gradebook. 
After entering results in the canvas gradebook, the next tasks should be applying special grades to individuals and importing gradebook, they should be done in parallel. 
When applying special grades to individuals is completed, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: calculating the grades and preparing grades for SSO. 
Once calculating the grades occurs, one or more of the following paths should be executed: applying score criteria, selecting exam assignment. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then one or more of the following paths should be executed: reviewing course summary, applying any changes. 
After that, exporting the course summary should be done. 
When exporting the course summary is completed, submitting results to SSO should be done. 
The process is now completed.
