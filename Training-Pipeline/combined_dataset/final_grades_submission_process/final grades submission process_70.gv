The following text is about the final grades submission process. It begins when you seek pre-approval of final grades. 
When seeking pre-approval of final grades is completed, one or more of the following paths should be executed: selecting exam assignment, preparing grades for SSO. 
Once preparing grades for SSO occurs, calculating the grades should be done. 
Then, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: applying any changes and reviewing course summary. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then the next tasks should be exporting the final grades and exporting the course summary, they should be done in parallel. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then sending examiners grade approval sheet should be done. 
The process is now completed.
