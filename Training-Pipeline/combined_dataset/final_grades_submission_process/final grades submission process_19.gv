The following text is about the final grades submission process. It starts with unmuting all gradebook columns. 
When unmuting all gradebook columns is completed, calculating the grades should be done. 
After calculating the grades, applying any changes needs to be done. 
Once applying any changes occurs, one or more of the following paths should be executed: exporting the course summary, exporting the final grades. 
Then, one or more of the following paths should be executed: getting approval signatures by the course director, submitting results to SSO. 
The process is now completed.
