The following text is about the final grades submission process. It begins when you enter results in the canvas gradebook. 
When entering results in the canvas gradebook is completed, one or more of the following paths should be executed: preparing grades for SSO, applying special grades to individuals, selecting exam assignment. 
Once selecting exam assignment occurs, the next tasks should be applying score criteria, calculating the grades and importing gradebook, they should be done in parallel. 
After that, you need to review grades summary.
When reviewing grades summary is completed, recalculating the grades should be done. 
When recalculating the grades is completed, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: getting approval signatures by the course director and submitting results to SSO. 
The process is now completed.
