The following description is about the final grades submission process. It starts with ensuring 'EX' or zero marks are applied as need. 
When ensuring 'EX' or zero marks are applied as need is completed, one or more of the following paths should be executed: applying special grades to individuals, preparing grades for SSO. 
After preparing grades for SSO, one or more of the following paths should be executed: importing gradebook, applying score criteria. 
Afterwards, the next tasks should be applying any changes, reviewing course summary and reviewing grades summary, they should be done in parallel. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then the process is split into 2 parallel branches: exporting the course summary and exporting the final grades. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then getting approval signatures by the course director should be done. 
The process is now completed.
