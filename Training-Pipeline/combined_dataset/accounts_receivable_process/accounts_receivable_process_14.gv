The text below is about the accounts receivable process. It begins when you record the buyer's details. 
When recording the buyer's details is completed, getting approval for post-credit check review needs to be done. 
Once getting approval for post-credit check review occurs, generating the invoice needs to be done. 
Once generating the invoice occurs, you need to establish monthly contact with your client.
After establishing monthly contact with your client, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: recording the sales on credit of goods and recording the sales on credit of services. 
The process is now completed.
