The following text is about the accounts receivable process. It starts with recording the buyer's details. 
When recording the buyer's details is completed, you need to get approval for post-credit check review.
Once getting approval for post-credit check review occurs, the process is split into 3 parallel branches: generating the invoice, sending the invoice in your accounting software and checking customer payment terms. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then you need to make a second physical copy.
Once making a second physical copy occurs, one or more of the following paths should be executed: recording the sales on credit of goods, recording the sales on credit of services. 
The process is now completed.
