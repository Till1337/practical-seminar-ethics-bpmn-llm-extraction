The text below is about the accounts receivable process. It begins when you record the buyer's details. 
After recording the buyer's details, sending a credit application form to the buyer needs to be done. 
Once sending a credit application form to the buyer occurs, the next tasks should be generating the invoice and sending the invoice in your accounting software, they should be done in parallel. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then recording your activity digitally should be done. 
Once recording your activity digitally occurs, one or more of the following paths should be executed: recording the sales on credit of goods, recording the sales on credit of services. 
The process is now completed.
