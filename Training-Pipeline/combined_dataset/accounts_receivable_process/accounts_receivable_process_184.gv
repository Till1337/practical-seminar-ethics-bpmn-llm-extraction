The following text is about the accounts receivable process. It begins when you record the buyer's details. 
After recording the buyer's details, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: sending a credit application form to the buyer and getting approval for post-credit check review. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then you need to send the invoice in your accounting software.
Once sending the invoice in your accounting software occurs, one or more of the following paths should be executed: establishing monthly contact with your client, recording your activity digitally, making a second physical copy. 
Then, one or more of the following paths should be executed: recording the sales on credit of services, recording the sales on credit of goods. 
The process is now completed.
