The following text is about the accounts receivable process. It begins when you record the buyer's details. 
When recording the buyer's details is completed, sending the buyer your terms of sale should be done. 
When sending the buyer your terms of sale is completed, checking customer payment terms needs to be done. 
When checking customer payment terms is completed, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: recording your activity digitally and establishing monthly contact with your client. 
When establishing monthly contact with your client is completed, making a second physical copy needs to be done. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then recording the sales on credit of services needs to be done. 
The process is now completed.
