The following description is about the accounts receivable process. It begins when you record the buyer's details. 
When recording the buyer's details is completed, you need to run a credit check on the purchasing company.
Once running a credit check on the purchasing company occurs, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: sending the invoice in your accounting software and generating the invoice. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then recording your activity digitally should be done. 
After recording your activity digitally, recording the sales on credit of services should be done. 
The process is now completed.
