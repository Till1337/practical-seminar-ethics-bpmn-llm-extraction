The following text is about the accounts receivable process. It starts with recording the buyer's details. 
When recording the buyer's details is completed, the process is split into 3 parallel branches: sending a credit application form to the buyer, getting approval for post-credit check review and running a credit check on the purchasing company. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then one or more of the following paths should be executed: generating the invoice, sending the invoice in your accounting software. 
After sending the invoice in your accounting software, checking customer payment terms should be done. 
Afterwards, you need to record your activity digitally.
Once recording your activity digitally occurs, recording the sales on credit of services needs to be done. 
The process is now completed.
