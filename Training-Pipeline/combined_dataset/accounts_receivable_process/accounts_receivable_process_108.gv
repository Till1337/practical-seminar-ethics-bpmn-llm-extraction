The following description is about the accounts receivable process. It starts with recording the buyer's details. 
Once recording the buyer's details occurs, getting approval for post-credit check review should be done. 
When getting approval for post-credit check review is completed, you need to send the invoice in your accounting software.
When sending the invoice in your accounting software is completed, the next tasks should be making a second physical copy, recording your activity digitally and establishing monthly contact with your client, they should be done in parallel. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then the next tasks should be recording the sales on credit of goods and recording the sales on credit of services, they should be done in parallel. 
The process is now completed.
