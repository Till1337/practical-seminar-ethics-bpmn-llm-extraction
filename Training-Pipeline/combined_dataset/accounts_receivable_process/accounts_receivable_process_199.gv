The following description is about the accounts receivable process. It starts with recording the buyer's details. 
After recording the buyer's details, sending a credit application form to the buyer should be done. 
When sending a credit application form to the buyer is completed, sending the invoice in your accounting software needs to be done. 
After sending the invoice in your accounting software, you need to make a second physical copy.
Once making a second physical copy occurs, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: recording the sales on credit of goods and recording the sales on credit of services. 
The process is now completed.
