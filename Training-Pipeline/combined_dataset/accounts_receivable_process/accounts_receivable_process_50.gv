The following description is about the accounts receivable process. It begins when you record the buyer's details. 
Once recording the buyer's details occurs, one or more of the following paths should be executed: sending the buyer your terms of sale, running a credit check on the purchasing company, sending a credit application form to the buyer. 
When sending a credit application form to the buyer is completed, getting approval for post-credit check review should be done. 
Afterwards, you need to check customer payment terms.
After checking customer payment terms, recording your activity digitally needs to be done. 
Once recording your activity digitally occurs, one or more of the following paths should be executed: recording the sales on credit of services, recording the sales on credit of goods. 
The process is now completed.
