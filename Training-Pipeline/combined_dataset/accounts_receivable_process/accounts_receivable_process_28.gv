The text below is about the accounts receivable process. It begins when you record the buyer's details. 
After recording the buyer's details, the next tasks should be running a credit check on the purchasing company and sending a credit application form to the buyer, they should be done in parallel. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then the process is split into 2 parallel branches: checking customer payment terms and generating the invoice. 
Once generating the invoice occurs, sending the invoice in your accounting software should be done. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then one or more of the following paths should be executed: making a second physical copy, establishing monthly contact with your client. 
After making a second physical copy, recording your activity digitally should be done. 
Afterwards, one or more of the following paths should be executed: recording the sales on credit of goods, recording the sales on credit of services. 
The process is now completed.
