The following description is about the accounts receivable process. It starts with recording the buyer's details. 
Once recording the buyer's details occurs, sending the buyer your terms of sale should be done. 
After sending the buyer your terms of sale, generating the invoice needs to be done. 
When generating the invoice is completed, the next tasks should be establishing monthly contact with your client and recording your activity digitally, they should be done in parallel. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then you need to record the sales on credit of goods.
The process is now completed.
