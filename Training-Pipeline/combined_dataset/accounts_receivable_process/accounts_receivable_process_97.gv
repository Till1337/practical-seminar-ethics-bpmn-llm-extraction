The following text is about the accounts receivable process. It begins when you record the buyer's details. 
When recording the buyer's details is completed, sending the buyer your terms of sale needs to be done. 
When sending the buyer your terms of sale is completed, one or more of the following paths should be executed: checking customer payment terms, generating the invoice. 
Once generating the invoice occurs, sending the invoice in your accounting software needs to be done. 
Afterwards, making a second physical copy should be done. 
When making a second physical copy is completed, recording the sales on credit of goods needs to be done. 
The process is now completed.
