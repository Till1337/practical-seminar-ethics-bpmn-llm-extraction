The following text is about the accounts receivable process. It begins when you record the buyer's details. 
After recording the buyer's details, sending the buyer your terms of sale should be done. 
Once sending the buyer your terms of sale occurs, the process is split into 3 parallel branches: checking customer payment terms, sending the invoice in your accounting software and generating the invoice. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then establishing monthly contact with your client should be done. 
When establishing monthly contact with your client is completed, one or more of the following paths should be executed: recording the sales on credit of services, recording the sales on credit of goods. 
The process is now completed.
