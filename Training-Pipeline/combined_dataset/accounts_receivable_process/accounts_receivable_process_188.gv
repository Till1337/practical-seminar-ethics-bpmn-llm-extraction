The following text is about the accounts receivable process. It starts with recording the buyer's details. 
Once recording the buyer's details occurs, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: getting approval for post-credit check review and sending the buyer your terms of sale. 
When sending the buyer your terms of sale is completed, running a credit check on the purchasing company should be done. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then the process is split into 2 parallel branches: checking customer payment terms and generating the invoice. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then you need to make a second physical copy.
After making a second physical copy, one or more of the following paths should be executed: recording the sales on credit of goods, recording the sales on credit of services. 
The process is now completed.
