The text below is about the accounts receivable process. It starts with recording the buyer's details. 
When recording the buyer's details is completed, the next tasks should be sending the buyer your terms of sale and sending a credit application form to the buyer, they should be done in parallel. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then generating the invoice should be done. 
Once generating the invoice occurs, establishing monthly contact with your client needs to be done. 
When establishing monthly contact with your client is completed, recording the sales on credit of services needs to be done. 
The process is now completed.
