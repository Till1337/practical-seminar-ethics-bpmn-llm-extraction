The following description is about the startup due diligence for a venture capitalist. It starts with learning how to identify future failures. 
After learning how to identify future failures, the next tasks should be specificking product market size and specificking product market share, they should be done in parallel. 
When specificking product market share is completed, checking location of startup needs to be done. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then the process is split into 2 parallel branches: reviewing relationship to founder and reviewing enthusiasm. 
When reviewing relationship to founder is completed, one or more of the following paths should be executed: reviewing team chemistry, reviewing the business plan. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then one or more of the following paths should be executed: checking income statements, checking exit strategy, checking cash flow. 
After that, one or more of the following paths should be executed: knowing exact competition, projecting the market share. 
Then, the next tasks should be checking insurance and checking trademarks, they should be done in parallel. 
The process is now completed.
