The following description is about the startup due diligence for a venture capitalist. It begins when you learn how to identify future failures. 
When learning how to identify future failures is completed, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: doing the SWOT analysis and specificking product market size. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then one or more of the following paths should be executed: reviewing number of employees, reviewing enthusiasm, reviewing relationship to founder. 
When reviewing relationship to founder is completed, one or more of the following paths should be executed: reviewing the business plan, reviewing trustworthiness. 
After that, checking cash flow needs to be done. 
When checking cash flow is completed, you need to analyze the growth stage of competition.
When analyzing the growth stage of competition is completed, checking past lawsuits should be done. 
The process is now completed.
