The text below is about the startup due diligence for a venture capitalist. It begins when you learn how to identify future failures. 
When learning how to identify future failures is completed, one or more of the following paths should be executed: considering product necessity, making plans for future products. 
Afterwards, you need to review number of employees.
Once reviewing number of employees occurs, checking exit strategy should be done. 
Once checking exit strategy occurs, projecting the market share needs to be done. 
Once projecting the market share occurs, you need to check patents.
The process is now completed.
