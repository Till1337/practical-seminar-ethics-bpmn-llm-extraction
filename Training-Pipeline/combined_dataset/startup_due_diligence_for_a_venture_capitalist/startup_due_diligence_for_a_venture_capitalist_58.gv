The following text is about the startup due diligence for a venture capitalist. It starts with learning how to identify future failures. 
After learning how to identify future failures, the next tasks should be specificking product market share and doing the SWOT analysis, they should be done in parallel. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then the next tasks should be reviewing relationship to founder and reviewing enthusiasm, they should be done in parallel. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then the next tasks should be checking current debt and checking exit strategy, they should be done in parallel. 
Once checking current debt occurs, the next tasks should be checking income statements and checking quarterly projections, they should be done in parallel. 
Once checking quarterly projections occurs, checking cash flow needs to be done. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then projecting the market share should be done. 
When projecting the market share is completed, you need to check past lawsuits.
The process is now completed.
