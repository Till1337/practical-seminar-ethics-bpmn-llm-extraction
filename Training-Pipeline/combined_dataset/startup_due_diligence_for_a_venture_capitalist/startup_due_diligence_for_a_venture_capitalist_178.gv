The following text is about the startup due diligence for a venture capitalist. It starts with learning how to identify future failures. 
Once learning how to identify future failures occurs, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: specificking product rate of growth and making plans for future products. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then you need to review company mission and direction.
When reviewing company mission and direction is completed, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: checking quarterly projections and checking current debt. 
After checking quarterly projections, checking exit strategy should be done. 
Once checking current debt occurs, the next tasks should be checking cash flow and checking income statements, they should be done in parallel. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then the next tasks should be knowing exact competition and analyzing the growth stage of competition, they should be done in parallel. 
When analyzing the growth stage of competition is completed, the next tasks should be analyzing the reputation of competition and projecting the market share, they should be done in parallel. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then checking trademarks should be done. 
The process is now completed.
