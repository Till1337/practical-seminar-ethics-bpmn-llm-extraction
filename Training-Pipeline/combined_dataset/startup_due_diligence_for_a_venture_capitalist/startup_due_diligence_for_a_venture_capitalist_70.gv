The following text is about the startup due diligence for a venture capitalist. It starts with learning how to identify future failures. 
Once learning how to identify future failures occurs, the next tasks should be specificking product market share, doing the SWOT analysis and specificking product rate of growth, they should be done in parallel. 
Once specificking product market share occurs, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: making plans for future products and considering product necessity. 
When considering product necessity is completed, the next tasks should be specificking product market size and specificking product details, they should be done in parallel. 
After specificking product rate of growth, you need to check location of startup.
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then reviewing trustworthiness should be done. 
Once reviewing trustworthiness occurs, checking cash flow should be done. 
When checking cash flow is completed, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: knowing exact competition and analyzing the reputation of competition. 
When knowing exact competition is completed, one or more of the following paths should be executed: projecting the market share, analyzing the growth stage of competition. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then you need to check past lawsuits.
The process is now completed.
