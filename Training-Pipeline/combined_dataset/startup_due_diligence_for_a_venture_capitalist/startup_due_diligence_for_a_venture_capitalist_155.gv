The following text is about the startup due diligence for a venture capitalist. It begins when you learn how to identify future failures. 
When learning how to identify future failures is completed, specificking product market size should be done. 
When specificking product market size is completed, the next tasks should be reviewing relationship to founder and reviewing ability as a team leader, they should be done in parallel. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then one or more of the following paths should be executed: checking cash flow, checking income statements. 
After that, analyzing the reputation of competition should be done. 
Once analyzing the reputation of competition occurs, checking insurance should be done. 
The process is now completed.
