The following description is about the startup due diligence for a venture capitalist. It starts with learning why startups fail so often. 
After learning why startups fail so often, the process is split into 3 parallel branches: making plans for future products, specificking product rate of growth and specificking product market size. 
After specificking product rate of growth, you need to specific product market share.
When specificking product market size is completed, considering product necessity should be done. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then the next tasks should be reviewing number of employees and reviewing relationship to founder, they should be done in parallel. 
Once reviewing number of employees occurs, the next tasks should be reviewing trustworthiness and reviewing expertise, they should be done in parallel. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then you need to check income statements.
When checking income statements is completed, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: projecting the market share and analyzing the reputation of competition. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then one or more of the following paths should be executed: checking insurance, checking patents. 
Once checking insurance occurs, checking past lawsuits needs to be done. 
The process is now completed.
