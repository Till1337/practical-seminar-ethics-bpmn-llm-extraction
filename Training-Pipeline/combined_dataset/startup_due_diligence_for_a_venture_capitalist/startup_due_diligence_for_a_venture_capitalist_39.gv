The text below is about the startup due diligence for a venture capitalist. It starts with learning how to identify future failures. 
After learning how to identify future failures, the next tasks should be specificking product market share and considering product necessity, they should be done in parallel. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then you need to review relationship to founder.
When reviewing relationship to founder is completed, checking current debt should be done. 
When checking current debt is completed, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: analyzing the reputation of competition and knowing exact competition. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then checking trademarks needs to be done. 
The process is now completed.
