The following description is about the startup due diligence for a venture capitalist. It starts with learning how to identify future failures. 
After learning how to identify future failures, one or more of the following paths should be executed: specificking product market size, specificking product details. 
Afterwards, one or more of the following paths should be executed: reviewing number of employees, reviewing expertise, reviewing ability as a team leader. 
Once reviewing number of employees occurs, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: reviewing enthusiasm and reviewing the business plan. 
Afterwards, one or more of the following paths should be executed: checking current debt, checking income statements. 
After that, analyzing the growth stage of competition needs to be done. 
Once analyzing the growth stage of competition occurs, one or more of the following paths should be executed: checking trademarks, checking past lawsuits. 
The process is now completed.
