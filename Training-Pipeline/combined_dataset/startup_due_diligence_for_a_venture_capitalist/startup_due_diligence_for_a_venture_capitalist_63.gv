The following text is about the startup due diligence for a venture capitalist. It starts with learning why startups fail so often. 
When learning why startups fail so often is completed, considering product necessity needs to be done. 
Once considering product necessity occurs, you need to review employee salary and benefits.
Once reviewing employee salary and benefits occurs, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: checking current debt and checking cash flow. 
When checking current debt is completed, the next tasks should be checking quarterly projections and checking income statements, they should be done in parallel. 
After checking quarterly projections, you need to check exit strategy.
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then the next tasks should be analyzing the growth stage of competition and analyzing the reputation of competition, they should be done in parallel. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then checking past lawsuits should be done. 
The process is now completed.
