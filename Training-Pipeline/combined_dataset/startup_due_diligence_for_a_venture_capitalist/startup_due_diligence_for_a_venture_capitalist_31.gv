The following text is about the startup due diligence for a venture capitalist. It starts with learning how to identify future failures. 
After learning how to identify future failures, one or more of the following paths should be executed: specificking product market size, specificking product rate of growth. 
Then, reviewing company mission and direction needs to be done. 
Once reviewing company mission and direction occurs, one or more of the following paths should be executed: checking cash flow, checking income statements, checking quarterly projections. 
After that, one or more of the following paths should be executed: analyzing the growth stage of competition, projecting the market share, analyzing the reputation of competition. 
Then, one or more of the following paths should be executed: checking past lawsuits, checking trademarks. 
When checking trademarks is completed, you need to check insurance.
The process is now completed.
