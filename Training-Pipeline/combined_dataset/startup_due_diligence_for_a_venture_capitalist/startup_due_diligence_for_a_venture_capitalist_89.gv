The following text is about the startup due diligence for a venture capitalist. It starts with learning how to identify future failures. 
When learning how to identify future failures is completed, considering product necessity needs to be done. 
Once considering product necessity occurs, one or more of the following paths should be executed: reviewing team chemistry, reviewing relationship to founder. 
After that, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: checking cash flow and checking quarterly projections. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then one or more of the following paths should be executed: analyzing the reputation of competition, knowing exact competition, analyzing the growth stage of competition. 
Afterwards, checking patents should be done. 
The process is now completed.
