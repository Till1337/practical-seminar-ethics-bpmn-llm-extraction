The text below is about the startup due diligence for a venture capitalist. It begins when you learn how to identify future failures. 
When learning how to identify future failures is completed, doing the SWOT analysis should be doingne. 
Once doing the SWOT analysis occurs, you need to review expertise.
Once reviewing expertise occurs, you need to check cash flow.
After checking cash flow, the next tasks should be analyzing the reputation of competition and analyzing the growth stage of competition, they should be done in parallel. 
When analyzing the growth stage of competition is completed, you need to know exact competition.
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then you need to check insurance.
The process is now completed.
