The following description is about the startup due diligence for a venture capitalist. It begins when you learn why startups fail so often. 
Once learning why startups fail so often occurs, checking location of startup should be done. 
When checking location of startup is completed, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: reviewing employee salary and benefits and reviewing number of employees. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then checking exit strategy should be done. 
When checking exit strategy is completed, the next tasks should be projecting the market share and analyzing the growth stage of competition, they should be done in parallel. 
When projecting the market share is completed, one or more of the following paths should be executed: analyzing the reputation of competition, knowing exact competition. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then the process is split into 2 parallel branches: checking trademarks and checking past lawsuits. 
After checking past lawsuits, you need to check patents.
The process is now completed.
