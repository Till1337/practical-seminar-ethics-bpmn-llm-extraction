The following description is about the startup due diligence for a venture capitalist. It starts with learning why startups fail so often. 
Once learning why startups fail so often occurs, checking location of startup needs to be done. 
When checking location of startup is completed, the next tasks should be reviewing employee salary and benefits and reviewing trustworthiness, they should be done in parallel. 
When reviewing employee salary and benefits is completed, you need to review company mission and direction.
When reviewing trustworthiness is completed, reviewing expertise should be done. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then one or more of the following paths should be executed: checking exit strategy, checking cash flow. 
Once checking cash flow occurs, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: checking income statements and checking quarterly projections. 
After checking income statements, you need to check current debt.
After that, the next tasks should be projecting the market share, analyzing the reputation of competition and analyzing the growth stage of competition, they should be done in parallel. 
When projecting the market share is completed, knowing exact competition should be done. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then checking trademarks should be done. 
The process is now completed.
