The text below is about the startup due diligence for a venture capitalist. It starts with learning how to identify future failures. 
After learning how to identify future failures, you need to specific product rate of growth.
After specificking product rate of growth, reviewing number of employees should be done. 
After reviewing number of employees, one or more of the following paths should be executed: checking cash flow, checking income statements, checking exit strategy. 
Once checking cash flow occurs, you need to check current debt.
After checking exit strategy, checking quarterly projections should be done. 
After that, knowing exact competition should be done. 
When knowing exact competition is completed, the process is split into 3 parallel branches: checking past lawsuits, checking patents and checking insurance. 
After checking past lawsuits, you need to check trademarks.
The process is now completed.
