The following text is about the startup due diligence for a venture capitalist. It starts with learning how to identify future failures. 
After learning how to identify future failures, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: checking location of startup and specificking product rate of growth. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then reviewing trustworthiness needs to be done. 
Once reviewing trustworthiness occurs, checking current debt needs to be done. 
When checking current debt is completed, one or more of the following paths should be executed: projecting the market share, analyzing the reputation of competition. 
Afterwards, checking trademarks needs to be done. 
The process is now completed.
