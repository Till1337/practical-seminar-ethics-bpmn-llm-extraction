The following description is about the budget preparation process. It starts with recording basic details. 
Once recording basic details occurs, you need to review the most recent budget.
After reviewing the most recent budget, you need to prioritize three to five goals.
Once prioritizing three to five goals occurs, the process is split into 3 parallel branches: listing all department expenses, estimating the average monthly cost and calculating the total annual budget. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then the process is split into 2 parallel branches: listing all sources of income and projecting total annual income. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then one or more of the following paths should be executed: finalizing the budget, recording financial data in a budget spreadsheet. 
Then, assigning management responsibilities should be done. 
The process is now completed.
