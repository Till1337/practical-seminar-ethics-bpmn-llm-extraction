The following text is about the budget preparation process. It starts with setting target date for approval. 
Once setting target date for approval occurs, you need to evaluate any significant variances.
Once evaluating any significant variances occurs, determining ways of achieving the goals needs to be done. 
When determining ways of achieving the goals is completed, the next tasks should be listing all department expenses, calculating the total annual budget and estimating the average monthly cost, they should be done in parallel. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then the next tasks should be projecting total annual income and listing all sources of income, they should be done in parallel. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then the process is split into 2 parallel branches: finalizing the budget and recording financial data in a budget spreadsheet. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then the next tasks should be obtaining approval from top management, incorporating into the master budget and assigning management responsibilities, they should be done in parallel. 
When assigning management responsibilities is completed, you need to request approval from top management.
The process is now completed.
