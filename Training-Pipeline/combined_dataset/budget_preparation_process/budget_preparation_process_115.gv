The following description is about the budget preparation process. It begins when you set target date for approval. 
Once setting target date for approval occurs, you need to evaluate any significant variances.
After evaluating any significant variances, you need to determine ways of achieving the goals.
After determining ways of achieving the goals, the process is split into 3 parallel branches: calculating the total annual budget, estimating the average monthly cost and listing all department expenses. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then one or more of the following paths should be executed: projecting total annual income, listing all sources of income. 
Then, recording financial data in a budget spreadsheet should be done. 
After recording financial data in a budget spreadsheet, the next tasks should be obtaining approval from top management and requesting approval from top management, they should be done in parallel. 
Once obtaining approval from top management occurs, assigning management responsibilities needs to be done. 
The process is now completed.
