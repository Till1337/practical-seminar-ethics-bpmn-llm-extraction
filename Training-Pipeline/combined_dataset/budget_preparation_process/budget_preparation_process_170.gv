The following text is about the budget preparation process. It begins when you set target date for approval. 
Once setting target date for approval occurs, one or more of the following paths should be executed: evaluating any significant variances, reviewing the most recent budget. 
Then, you need to determine ways of achieving the goals.
After determining ways of achieving the goals, you need to list all department expenses.
Once listing all department expenses occurs, you need to list all sources of income.
Once listing all sources of income occurs, finalizing the budget needs to be done. 
When finalizing the budget is completed, assigning management responsibilities needs to be done. 
The process is now completed.
