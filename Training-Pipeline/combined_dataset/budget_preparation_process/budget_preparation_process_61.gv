The following text is about the budget preparation process. It begins when you record basic details. 
After recording basic details, reviewing the most recent budget should be done. 
Once reviewing the most recent budget occurs, defining three to five goals should be done. 
Once defining three to five goals occurs, estimating the average monthly cost should be done. 
After estimating the average monthly cost, projecting total annual income needs to be done. 
After projecting total annual income, you need to record financial data in a budget spreadsheet.
When recording financial data in a budget spreadsheet is completed, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: incorporating into the master budget and assigning management responsibilities. 
The process is now completed.
