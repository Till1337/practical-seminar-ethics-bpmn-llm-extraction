The following text is about the budget preparation process. It starts with setting target date for approval. 
When setting target date for approval is completed, reviewing the most recent budget needs to be done. 
Once reviewing the most recent budget occurs, the next tasks should be defining three to five goals and prioritizing three to five goals, they should be done in parallel. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then calculating the total annual budget should be done. 
After calculating the total annual budget, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: listing all sources of income and projecting total annual income. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then the process is split into 2 parallel branches: recording financial data in a budget spreadsheet and finalizing the budget. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then the next tasks should be assigning management responsibilities and incorporating into the master budget, they should be done in parallel. 
After assigning management responsibilities, the next tasks should be requesting approval from top management and obtaining approval from top management, they should be done in parallel. 
The process is now completed.
