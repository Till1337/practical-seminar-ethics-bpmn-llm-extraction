The following text is about the budget preparation process. It starts with recording basic details. 
When recording basic details is completed, one or more of the following paths should be executed: evaluating any significant variances, reviewing the most recent budget. 
Afterwards, one or more of the following paths should be executed: prioritizing three to five goals, defining three to five goals. 
Then, listing all department expenses should be done. 
Once listing all department expenses occurs, you need to project total annual income.
When projecting total annual income is completed, recording financial data in a budget spreadsheet needs to be done. 
After recording financial data in a budget spreadsheet, one or more of the following paths should be executed: obtaining approval from top management, requesting approval from top management. 
The process is now completed.
