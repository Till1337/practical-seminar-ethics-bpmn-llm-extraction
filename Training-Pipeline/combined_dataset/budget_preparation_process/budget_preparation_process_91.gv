The following text is about the budget preparation process. It starts with setting target date for approval. 
After setting target date for approval, evaluating any significant variances needs to be done. 
When evaluating any significant variances is completed, one or more of the following paths should be executed: prioritizing three to five goals, defining three to five goals. 
After that, you need to calculate the total annual budget.
When calculating the total annual budget is completed, listing all sources of income needs to be done. 
After listing all sources of income, recording financial data in a budget spreadsheet should be done. 
Once recording financial data in a budget spreadsheet occurs, the next tasks should be assigning management responsibilities and obtaining approval from top management, they should be done in parallel. 
The process is now completed.
