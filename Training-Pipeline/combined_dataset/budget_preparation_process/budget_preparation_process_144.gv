The following text is about the budget preparation process. It begins when you set target date for approval. 
After setting target date for approval, evaluating any significant variances should be done. 
After evaluating any significant variances, one or more of the following paths should be executed: determining ways of achieving the goals, defining three to five goals. 
Once defining three to five goals occurs, prioritizing three to five goals should be done. 
After that, calculating the total annual budget needs to be done. 
When calculating the total annual budget is completed, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: listing all sources of income and projecting total annual income. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then you need to record financial data in a budget spreadsheet.
After recording financial data in a budget spreadsheet, one or more of the following paths should be executed: obtaining approval from top management, incorporating into the master budget. 
Once incorporating into the master budget occurs, assigning management responsibilities should be done. 
The process is now completed.
