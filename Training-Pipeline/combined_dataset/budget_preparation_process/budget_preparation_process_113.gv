The text below is about the budget preparation process. It begins when you set target date for approval. 
Once setting target date for approval occurs, reviewing the most recent budget needs to be done. 
Once reviewing the most recent budget occurs, you need to determine ways of achieving the goals.
Once determining ways of achieving the goals occurs, the next tasks should be calculating the total annual budget and listing all department expenses, they should be done in parallel. 
After calculating the total annual budget, estimating the average monthly cost needs to be done. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then you need to list all sources of income.
Once listing all sources of income occurs, you need to finalize the budget.
After finalizing the budget, incorporating into the master budget needs to be done. 
The process is now completed.
