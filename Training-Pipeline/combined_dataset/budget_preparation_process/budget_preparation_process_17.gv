The text below is about the budget preparation process. It begins when you set target date for approval. 
When setting target date for approval is completed, evaluating any significant variances should be done. 
After evaluating any significant variances, determining ways of achieving the goals needs to be done. 
When determining ways of achieving the goals is completed, one or more of the following paths should be executed: estimating the average monthly cost, listing all department expenses. 
Afterwards, you need to project total annual income.
When projecting total annual income is completed, you need to finalize the budget.
When finalizing the budget is completed, the next tasks should be assigning management responsibilities, incorporating into the master budget and obtaining approval from top management, they should be done in parallel. 
After assigning management responsibilities, requesting approval from top management should be done. 
The process is now completed.
