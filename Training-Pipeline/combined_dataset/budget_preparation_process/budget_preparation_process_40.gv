The text below is about the budget preparation process. It begins when you record basic details. 
Once recording basic details occurs, evaluating any significant variances needs to be done. 
When evaluating any significant variances is completed, one or more of the following paths should be executed: defining three to five goals, prioritizing three to five goals. 
When prioritizing three to five goals is completed, determining ways of achieving the goals should be done. 
Then, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: estimating the average monthly cost and calculating the total annual budget. 
After estimating the average monthly cost, listing all department expenses needs to be done. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then you need to list all sources of income.
Once listing all sources of income occurs, recording financial data in a budget spreadsheet should be done. 
When recording financial data in a budget spreadsheet is completed, obtaining approval from top management should be done. 
The process is now completed.
