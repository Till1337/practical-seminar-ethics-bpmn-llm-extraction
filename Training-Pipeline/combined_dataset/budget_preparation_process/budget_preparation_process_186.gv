The following text is about the budget preparation process. It begins when you set target date for approval. 
Once setting target date for approval occurs, evaluating any significant variances needs to be done. 
Once evaluating any significant variances occurs, prioritizing three to five goals should be done. 
Once prioritizing three to five goals occurs, calculating the total annual budget needs to be done. 
After calculating the total annual budget, projecting total annual income needs to be done. 
After projecting total annual income, one or more of the following paths should be executed: finalizing the budget, recording financial data in a budget spreadsheet. 
Then, incorporating into the master budget should be done. 
The process is now completed.
