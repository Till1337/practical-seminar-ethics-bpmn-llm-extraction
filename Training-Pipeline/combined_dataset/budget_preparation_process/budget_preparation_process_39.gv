The text below is about the budget preparation process. It starts with recording basic details. 
Once recording basic details occurs, the next tasks should be reviewing the most recent budget and evaluating any significant variances, they should be done in parallel. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then one or more of the following paths should be executed: defining three to five goals, prioritizing three to five goals. 
Once defining three to five goals occurs, you need to determine ways of achieving the goals.
Afterwards, one or more of the following paths should be executed: estimating the average monthly cost, listing all department expenses. 
Afterwards, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: projecting total annual income and listing all sources of income. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then recording financial data in a budget spreadsheet should be done. 
Once recording financial data in a budget spreadsheet occurs, you need to request approval from top management.
The process is now completed.
