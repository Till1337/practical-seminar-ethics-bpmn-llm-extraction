The following text is about the budget preparation process. It begins when you record basic details. 
Once recording basic details occurs, one or more of the following paths should be executed: reviewing the most recent budget, evaluating any significant variances. 
Afterwards, determining ways of achieving the goals should be done. 
When determining ways of achieving the goals is completed, one or more of the following paths should be executed: estimating the average monthly cost, listing all department expenses. 
Afterwards, one or more of the following paths should be executed: projecting total annual income, listing all sources of income. 
Then, one or more of the following paths should be executed: finalizing the budget, recording financial data in a budget spreadsheet. 
After that, one or more of the following paths should be executed: obtaining approval from top management, incorporating into the master budget. 
After obtaining approval from top management, one or more of the following paths should be executed: requesting approval from top management, assigning management responsibilities. 
The process is now completed.
