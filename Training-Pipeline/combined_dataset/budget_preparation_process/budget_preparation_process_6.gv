The text below is about the budget preparation process. It starts with setting target date for approval. 
Once setting target date for approval occurs, one or more of the following paths should be executed: evaluating any significant variances, reviewing the most recent budget. 
Afterwards, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: defining three to five goals and prioritizing three to five goals. 
After defining three to five goals, you need to determine ways of achieving the goals.
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then calculating the total annual budget needs to be done. 
After calculating the total annual budget, one or more of the following paths should be executed: projecting total annual income, listing all sources of income. 
After that, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: recording financial data in a budget spreadsheet and finalizing the budget. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then assigning management responsibilities needs to be done. 
The process is now completed.
