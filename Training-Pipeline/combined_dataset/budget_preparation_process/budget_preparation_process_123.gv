The following text is about the budget preparation process. It begins when you set target date for approval. 
Once setting target date for approval occurs, reviewing the most recent budget needs to be done. 
After reviewing the most recent budget, the next tasks should be determining ways of achieving the goals, prioritizing three to five goals and defining three to five goals, they should be done in parallel. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then one or more of the following paths should be executed: estimating the average monthly cost, listing all department expenses. 
After that, you need to project total annual income.
After projecting total annual income, the next tasks should be recording financial data in a budget spreadsheet and finalizing the budget, they should be done in parallel. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then you need to obtain approval from top management.
The process is now completed.
