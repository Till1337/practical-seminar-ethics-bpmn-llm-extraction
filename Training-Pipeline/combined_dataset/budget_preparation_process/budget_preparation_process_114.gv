The text below is about the budget preparation process. It begins when you set target date for approval. 
After setting target date for approval, evaluating any significant variances should be done. 
When evaluating any significant variances is completed, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: defining three to five goals and determining ways of achieving the goals. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then the process is split into 2 parallel branches: estimating the average monthly cost and listing all department expenses. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then one or more of the following paths should be executed: listing all sources of income, projecting total annual income. 
Then, one or more of the following paths should be executed: finalizing the budget, recording financial data in a budget spreadsheet. 
Then, one or more of the following paths should be executed: requesting approval from top management, obtaining approval from top management. 
The process is now completed.
