The following text is about the budget preparation process. It starts with recording basic details. 
Once recording basic details occurs, you need to evaluate any significant variances.
When evaluating any significant variances is completed, the next tasks should be prioritizing three to five goals and determining ways of achieving the goals, they should be done in parallel. 
After prioritizing three to five goals, defining three to five goals needs to be done. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then you need to calculate the total annual budget.
Once calculating the total annual budget occurs, one or more of the following paths should be executed: listing all sources of income, projecting total annual income. 
Then, finalizing the budget should be done. 
After finalizing the budget, obtaining approval from top management needs to be done. 
The process is now completed.
