The following text is about the budget preparation process. It begins when you set target date for approval. 
When setting target date for approval is completed, evaluating any significant variances should be done. 
Once evaluating any significant variances occurs, prioritizing three to five goals should be done. 
After prioritizing three to five goals, one or more of the following paths should be executed: listing all department expenses, calculating the total annual budget. 
Then, you need to project total annual income.
When projecting total annual income is completed, one or more of the following paths should be executed: recording financial data in a budget spreadsheet, finalizing the budget. 
Then, incorporating into the master budget should be done. 
The process is now completed.
