The text below is about the loan application process. It starts with providing the previous loan statement to the lender. 
Once providing the previous loan statement to the lender occurs, one or more of the following paths should be executed: completing the loan application by borrower, receiving the application by credit department. 
Then, checking for the completeness should be taken into account. if all is complete, then nothing needs to be done, otherwise you should send application back to the applicant. 
Afterwards, one or more of the following paths should be executed: beginning the underwriting process, checking the credit score and risk score. 
After that, approving the loan application should be done. 
When approving the loan application is completed, receiving the loans fund should be done. 
The process is now completed.
