The text below is about the order fulfillment process. It starts with recording order details. 
Once recording order details occurs, the next tasks should be requesting the ordered products from your inventory and checking that the products are in stock, they should be done in parallel. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then packaging the items securely needs to be done. 
When packaging the items securely is completed, one or more of the following paths should be executed: loading items into the delivery vehicle, examining your other orders for delivery overlaps. 
Afterwards, sending a confirmation email to the customer should be done. 
The process is now completed.
