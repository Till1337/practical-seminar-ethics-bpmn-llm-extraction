The following text is about the final grades submission process. It begins when you ensure 'EX' or zero marks are applied as need. 
When ensuring 'EX' or zero marks are applied as need is completed, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: importing gradebook and applying special grades to individuals. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then reviewing grades summary should be done. 
When reviewing grades summary is completed, exporting the final grades needs to be done. 
When exporting the final grades is completed, submitting results to SSO needs to be done. 
The process is now completed.
