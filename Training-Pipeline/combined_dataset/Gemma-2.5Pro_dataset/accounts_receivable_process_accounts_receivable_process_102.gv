The following description is about the accounts receivable process. It begins when you record the buyer's details. 
When recording the buyer's details is completed, running a credit check on the purchasing company needs to be done. 
When running a credit check on the purchasing company is completed, one or more of the following paths should be executed: sending the invoice in your accounting software, checking customer payment terms. 
After that, the next tasks should be establishing monthly contact with your client, making a second physical copy and recording your activity digitally, they should be done in parallel. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then the process is split into 2 parallel branches: recording the sales on credit of goods and recording the sales on credit of services. 
The process is now completed.
