The following text is about the client onboarding process for a marketing agency. It starts with having an onboarding call with the client. 
After having an onboarding call with the client, one or more of the following paths should be executed: getting approval for the first draft, updating client's CRM. 
Then, the next tasks should be informing client of project start and assigning work to the team, they should be done in parallel. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then one or more of the following paths should be executed: having a follow-up call, sending a post-onboarding survey, making changes based on follow-up call. 
The process is now completed.
