The text below is about the project management process. It begins when you make an introduction. 
When making an introduction is completed, recording the basic idea should be done. 
When recording the basic idea is completed, one or more of the following paths should be executed: drawing up a project plan, setting a budget, stating the available resources. 
When drawing up a project plan is completed, laying out a timeline should be done. 
Afterwards, having a kickoff meeting needs to be done. 
After having a kickoff meeting, keeping communication needs to be done. 
When keeping communication is completed, one or more of the following paths should be executed: evaluating project outcomes, terminating contractors. 
The process is now completed.
