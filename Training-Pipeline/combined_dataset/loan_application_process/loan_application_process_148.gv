The following text is about the loan application process. It begins when you provide the previous loan statement to the lender. 
When providing the previous loan statement to the lender is completed, you need to receive the application by credit department.
After receiving the application by credit department, one or more of the following paths should be executed: checking for the completeness, giving the written notice to applicant. 
Then, one or more of the following paths should be executed: beginning the underwriting process, checking the credit score and risk score. 
After that, one or more of the following paths should be executed: approving the loan application, changing the interest rate. 
When approving the loan application is completed, reducing loan amount should be done.
