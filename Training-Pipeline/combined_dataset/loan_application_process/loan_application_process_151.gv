The text below is about the loan application process. It begins when you submit the ID proof to the lender. 
Once submitting the ID proof to the lender occurs, one or more of the following paths should be executed: completing the loan application by borrower, receiving the application by credit department. 
Then, checking for the completeness should be considered. if all is complete, then nothing needs to be done, otherwise you should send application back to the applicant. 
Afterwards, one or more of the following paths should be executed: checking the credit score and risk score, beginning the underwriting process. 
Then, changing the interest rate should be done. 
When changing the interest rate is completed, receiving the loans fund should be done. 
The process is now completed.
