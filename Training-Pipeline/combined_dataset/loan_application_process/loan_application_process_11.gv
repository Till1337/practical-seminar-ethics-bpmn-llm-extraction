The text below is about the loan application process. It begins when you provide the previous loan statement to the lender. 
After providing the previous loan statement to the lender, one or more of the following paths should be executed: receiving the application by credit department, completing the loan application by borrower. 
Then, giving the written notice to applicant should be done. 
Once giving the written notice to applicant occurs, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: checking the credit score and risk score and beginning the underwriting process. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then the next tasks should be changing the interest rate and approving the loan application, they should be done in parallel. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then receiving the loans fund should be done. 
The process is now completed.
