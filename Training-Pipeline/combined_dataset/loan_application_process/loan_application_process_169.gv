The text below is about the loan application process. It begins when you provide the previous loan statement to the lender. 
When providing the previous loan statement to the lender is completed, one or more of the following paths should be executed: completing the loan application by borrower, receiving the application by credit department. 
Afterwards, checking for the completeness should be taken into account. if all is complete, then nothing needs to be done, otherwise you should send application back to the applicant. 
After that, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: beginning the underwriting process and checking the credit score and risk score. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then the next tasks should be approving the loan application and changing the interest rate, they should be done in parallel. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then you need to receive the loans fund.
The process is now completed.
