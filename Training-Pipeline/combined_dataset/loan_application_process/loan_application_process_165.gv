The following description is about the loan application process. It starts with providing the bank statement to the lender. 
Once providing the bank statement to the lender occurs, one or more of the following paths should be executed: completing the loan application by borrower, receiving the application by credit department. 
Afterwards, checking for the completeness should be considered. if all is complete, then nothing needs to be done, otherwise you should check for the completeness. 
Then, you need to begin the underwriting process.
After beginning the underwriting process, approving the loan application needs to be done. 
After approving the loan application, you need to receive the loans fund.
The process is now completed.
