The following description is about the loan application process. It starts with submitting the ID proof to the lender. 
When submitting the ID proof to the lender is completed, the next tasks should be completing the loan application by borrower and receiving the application by credit department, they should be done in parallel. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then checking for the completeness should be taken into account. if all is complete, then nothing needs to be done, otherwise you should give the written notice to applicant. 
After that, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: beginning the underwriting process and checking the credit score and risk score. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then the process is split into 2 parallel branches: approving the loan application and changing the interest rate. 
Once approving the loan application occurs, reducing loan amount should be done. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then receiving the loans fund needs to be done. 
The process is now completed.
