The following description is about the loan application process. It begins when you submit the address proof to the lender. 
Once submitting the address proof to the lender occurs, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: completing the loan application by borrower and receiving the application by credit department. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then you need to send application back to the applicant.
When sending application back to the applicant is completed, one or more of the following paths should be executed: checking the credit score and risk score, beginning the underwriting process. 
After that, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: reducing loan amount and changing the interest rate. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then receiving the loans fund needs to be done. 
The process is now completed.
