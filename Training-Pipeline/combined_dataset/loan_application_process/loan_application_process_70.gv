The following text is about the loan application process. It starts with providing the bank statement to the lender. 
When providing the bank statement to the lender is completed, one or more of the following paths should be executed: completing the loan application by borrower, receiving the application by credit department. 
After that, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: checking for the completeness and giving the written notice to applicant. 
After giving the written notice to applicant, sending application back to the applicant needs to be done. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then one or more of the following paths should be executed: beginning the underwriting process, checking the credit score and risk score. 
Afterwards, reducing loan amount needs to be done. 
After reducing loan amount, you need to receive the loans fund.
The process is now completed.
