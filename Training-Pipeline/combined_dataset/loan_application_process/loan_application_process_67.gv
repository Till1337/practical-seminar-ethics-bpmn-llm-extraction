The text below is about the loan application process. It starts with submitting the ID proof to the lender. 
After submitting the ID proof to the lender, receiving the application by credit department needs to be done. 
Once receiving the application by credit department occurs, checking for the completeness should be considered. if all is complete, then nothing needs to be done, otherwise you should check for the completeness. 
After that, one or more of the following paths should be executed: checking the credit score and risk score, beginning the underwriting process. 
Then, one or more of the following paths should be executed: changing the interest rate, approving the loan application. 
Afterwards, receiving the loans fund needs to be done. 
The process is now completed.
