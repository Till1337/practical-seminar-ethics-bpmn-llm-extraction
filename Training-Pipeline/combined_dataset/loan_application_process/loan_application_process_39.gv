The following text is about the loan application process. It starts with submitting the address proof to the lender. 
When submitting the address proof to the lender is completed, you need to receive the application by credit department.
After receiving the application by credit department, checking for the completeness should be considered. if all is complete, then nothing needs to be done, otherwise you should give the written notice to applicant. 
After that, one or more of the following paths should be executed: beginning the underwriting process, checking the credit score and risk score. 
Then, reducing loan amount should be done. 
Once reducing loan amount occurs, receiving the loans fund should be done. 
The process is now completed.
