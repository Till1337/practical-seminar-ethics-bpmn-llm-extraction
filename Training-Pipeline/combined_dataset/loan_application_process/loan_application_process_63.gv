The following text is about the loan application process. It starts with providing the bank statement to the lender. 
Once providing the bank statement to the lender occurs, one or more of the following paths should be executed: receiving the application by credit department, completing the loan application by borrower. 
Afterwards, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: sending application back to the applicant and giving the written notice to applicant. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then one or more of the following paths should be executed: beginning the underwriting process, checking the credit score and risk score. 
Then, one or more of the following paths should be executed: changing the interest rate, reducing loan amount. 
After that, receiving the loans fund needs to be done. 
The process is now completed.
