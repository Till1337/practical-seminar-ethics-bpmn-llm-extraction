The following text is about the loan application process. It starts with submitting the ID proof to the lender. 
Once submitting the ID proof to the lender occurs, completing the loan application by borrower needs to be done. 
When completing the loan application by borrower is completingd, sending application back to the applicant needs to be done. 
After sending application back to the applicant, one or more of the following paths should be executed: beginning the underwriting process, checking the credit score and risk score. 
Then, the next tasks should be changing the interest rate and approving the loan application, they should be done in parallel. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then you need to receive the loans fund.
