The following description is about the loan application process. It begins when you submit the address proof to the lender. 
After submitting the address proof to the lender, the next tasks should be completing the loan application by borrower and receiving the application by credit department, they should be done in parallel. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then you need to give the written notice to applicant.
Once giving the written notice to applicant occurs, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: beginning the underwriting process and checking the credit score and risk score. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then the next tasks should be approving the loan application and changing the interest rate, they should be done in parallel. 
Once approving the loan application occurs, you need to reduce loan amount.
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then you need to receive the loans fund.
The process is now completed.
