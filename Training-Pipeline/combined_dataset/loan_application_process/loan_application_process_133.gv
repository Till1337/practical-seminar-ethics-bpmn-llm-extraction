The text below is about the loan application process. It begins when you provide the previous loan statement to the lender. 
After providing the previous loan statement to the lender, the next tasks should be receiving the application by credit department and completing the loan application by borrower, they should be done in parallel. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then checking for the completeness should be taken into account. if all is complete, then nothing needs to be done, otherwise you should send application back to the applicant. 
After that, one or more of the following paths should be executed: beginning the underwriting process, checking the credit score and risk score. 
Then, reducing loan amount needs to be done. 
After reducing loan amount, you need to receive the loans fund.
The process is now completed.
