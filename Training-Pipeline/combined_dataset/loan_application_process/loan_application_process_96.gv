The following text is about the loan application process. It starts with filling in the employment information form. 
When filling in the employment information form is completed, receiving the application by credit department should be done. 
Once receiving the application by credit department occurs, the next tasks should be checking for the completeness and sending application back to the applicant, they should be done in parallel. 
After checking for the completeness, you need to give the written notice to applicant.
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then the next tasks should be checking the credit score and risk score and beginning the underwriting process, they should be done in parallel. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then you need to reduce loan amount.
After reducing loan amount, receiving the loans fund needs to be done. 
The process is now completed.
