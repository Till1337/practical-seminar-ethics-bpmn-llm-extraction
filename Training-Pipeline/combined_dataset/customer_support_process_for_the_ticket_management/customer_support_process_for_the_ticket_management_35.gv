The following text is about the customer support process for the ticket management. It starts with checking the ticket type. 
After checking the ticket type, the next tasks should be determining ticket type as 'Technical Issue' and determining ticket type as 'Feature Request', they should be done in parallel. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then replicating the issue should be considered. if all could replicate, then nothing needs to be done, otherwise you should response ticket question. 
The process is now completed.
