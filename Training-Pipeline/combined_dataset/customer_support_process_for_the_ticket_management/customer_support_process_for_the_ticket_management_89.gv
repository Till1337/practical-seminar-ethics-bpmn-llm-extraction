The following description is about the customer support process for the ticket management. It starts with checking the ticket type. 
When checking the ticket type is completed, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: determining ticket type as 'Sales Question' and determining ticket type as 'Feature Request'. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then one or more of the following paths should be executed: testing technical issues, replicating the issue. 
The process is now completed.
