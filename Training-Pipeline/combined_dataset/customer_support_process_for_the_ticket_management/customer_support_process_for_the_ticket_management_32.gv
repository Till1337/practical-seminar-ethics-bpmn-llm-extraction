The following description is about the customer support process for the ticket management. It begins when you check the ticket type. 
Once checking the ticket type occurs, determining ticket type as 'Sales Question' needs to be done. 
Once determining ticket type as 'Sales Question' occurs, one or more of the following paths should be executed: responsing ticket question, replicating the issue. 
When responsing ticket question is completed, you need to test technical issues.
The process is now completed.
