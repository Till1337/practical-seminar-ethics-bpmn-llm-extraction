The text below is about the customer support process for the ticket management. It starts with checking the ticket type. 
When checking the ticket type is completed, one or more of the following paths should be executed: determining ticket type as 'Mixed-type question', determining ticket type as 'I'm not sure question'. 
Once determining ticket type as 'Mixed-type question' occurs, determining ticket type as 'App Question' should be done. 
After that, one or more of the following paths should be executed: responsing ticket question, testing technical issues. 
Once testing technical issues occurs, replicating the issue should be taken into account. if all could replicate, then nothing needs to be done, otherwise you should replicate the issue. 
The process is now completed.
