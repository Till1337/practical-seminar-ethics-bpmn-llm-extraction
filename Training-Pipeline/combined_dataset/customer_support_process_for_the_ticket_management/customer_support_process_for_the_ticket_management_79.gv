The following description is about the customer support process for the ticket management. It starts with checking the ticket type. 
After checking the ticket type, determining ticket type as 'I'm not sure question' needs to be done. 
When determining ticket type as 'I'm not sure question' is completed, one or more of the following paths should be executed: responsing ticket question, testing technical issues. 
When testing technical issues is completed, replicating the issue should be considered. if all could replicate, then nothing needs to be done, otherwise you should replicate the issue. 
The process is now completed.
