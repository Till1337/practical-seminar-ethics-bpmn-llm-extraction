The following description is about the customer support process for the ticket management. It begins when you check the ticket type. 
Once checking the ticket type occurs, the next tasks should be determining ticket type as 'Simple Question' and determining ticket type as 'Billing Question', they should be done in parallel. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then replicating the issue should be considered. if all could replicate, then nothing needs to be done, otherwise you should replicate the issue. 
The process is now completed.
