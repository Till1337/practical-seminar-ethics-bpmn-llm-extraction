The following text is about the customer support process for the ticket management. It starts with checking the ticket type. 
When checking the ticket type is completed, determining ticket type as 'I'm not sure question' needs to be done. 
When determining ticket type as 'I'm not sure question' is completed, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: replicating the issue and responsing ticket question. 
After replicating the issue, you need to test technical issues.
The process is now completed.
