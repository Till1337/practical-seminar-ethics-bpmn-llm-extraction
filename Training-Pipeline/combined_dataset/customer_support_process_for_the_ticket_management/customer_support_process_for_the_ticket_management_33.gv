The text below is about the customer support process for the ticket management. It starts with checking the ticket type. 
When checking the ticket type is completed, determining ticket type as 'App Question' should be done. 
After determining ticket type as 'App Question', the process is split into 2 parallel branches: testing technical issues and replicating the issue. 
The process is now completed.
