The text below is about the customer support process for the ticket management. It begins when you check the ticket type. 
When checking the ticket type is completed, determining ticket type as 'Mixed-type question' should be done. 
After determining ticket type as 'Mixed-type question', the process is split into 2 parallel branches: replicating the issue and responsing ticket question. 
The process is now completed.
