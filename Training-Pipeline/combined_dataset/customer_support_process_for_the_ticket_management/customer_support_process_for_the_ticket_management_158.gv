The following text is about the customer support process for the ticket management. It starts with checking the ticket type. 
Once checking the ticket type occurs, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: determining ticket type as 'Billing Question' and determining ticket type as 'Sales Question'. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then replicating the issue should be done. 
The process is now completed.
