The following text is about the customer support process for the ticket management. It starts with checking the ticket type. 
After checking the ticket type, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: determining ticket type as 'Billing Question' and determining ticket type as 'Feature Request'. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then testing technical issues should be done. 
The process is now completed.
