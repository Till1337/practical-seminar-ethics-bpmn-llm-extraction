The following text is about the order fulfillment process. It starts with confirming that payment has been received. 
When confirming that payment has been received is completed, performing quality checks should be done. 
When performing quality checks is completed, printing packing slip should be done. 
When printing packing slip is completed, the next tasks should be examining your other orders for delivery overlaps and arranging the delivery, they should be done in parallel.
