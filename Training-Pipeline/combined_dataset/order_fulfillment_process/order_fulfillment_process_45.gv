The following text is about the order fulfillment process. It begins when you confirm that payment has been received. 
When confirming that payment has been received is completed, you need to request the ordered products from your inventory.
After requesting the ordered products from your inventory, one or more of the following paths should be executed: getting approval, attaching the shipping label to the packaging, printing packing slip. 
After attaching the shipping label to the packaging, one or more of the following paths should be executed: printing invoice, measuring products. 
Once printing invoice occurs, packaging the items securely should be done. 
Afterwards, arranging the delivery should be done. 
Once arranging the delivery occurs, you need to send a confirmation email to the customer.
The process is now completed.
