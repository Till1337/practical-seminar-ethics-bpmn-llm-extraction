The following description is about the order fulfillment process. It begins when you confirm that payment has been received. 
Once confirming that payment has been received occurs, you need to record which products were taken from storage.
When recording which products were taken from storage is completed, one or more of the following paths should be executed: printing packing slip, measuring products. 
Afterwards, examining your other orders for delivery overlaps should be done. 
Once examining your other orders for delivery overlaps occurs, sending a confirmation email to the customer needs to be done. 
The process is now completed.
