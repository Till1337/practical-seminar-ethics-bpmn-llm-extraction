The following description is about the order fulfillment process. It starts with confirming that payment has been received. 
When confirming that payment has been received is completed, recording which products were taken from storage should be done. 
When recording which products were taken from storage is completed, the process is split into 3 parallel branches: printing invoice, printing packing slip and attaching the shipping label to the packaging. 
When printing invoice is completed, packaging the items securely should be done. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then one or more of the following paths should be executed: arranging the delivery, loading items into the delivery vehicle, examining your other orders for delivery overlaps. 
Afterwards, sending a confirmation email to the customer needs to be done. 
The process is now completed.
