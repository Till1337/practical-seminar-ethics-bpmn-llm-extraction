The following text is about the order fulfillment process. It begins when you confirm that payment has been received. 
Once confirming that payment has been received occurs, one or more of the following paths should be executed: recording which products were taken from storage, performing quality checks, requesting the ordered products from your inventory. 
Afterwards, the next tasks should be printing packing slip and getting approval, they should be done in parallel. 
When printing packing slip is completed, one or more of the following paths should be executed: packaging the items securely, printing invoice. 
Once printing invoice occurs, measuring products should be done. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then you need to examine your other orders for delivery overlaps.
Once examining your other orders for delivery overlaps occurs, you need to send a confirmation email to the customer.
The process is now completed.
