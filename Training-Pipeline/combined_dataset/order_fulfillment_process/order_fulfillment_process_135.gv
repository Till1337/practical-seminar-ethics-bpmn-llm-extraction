The following text is about the order fulfillment process. It begins when you confirm that payment has been received. 
After confirming that payment has been received, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: recording which products were taken from storage and checking that the products are in stock. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then printing invoice should be done. 
Once printing invoice occurs, examining your other orders for delivery overlaps needs to be done. 
After examining your other orders for delivery overlaps, sending a confirmation email to the customer needs to be done. 
The process is now completed.
