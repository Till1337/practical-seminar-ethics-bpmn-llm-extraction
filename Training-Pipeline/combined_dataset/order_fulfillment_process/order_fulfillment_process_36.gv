The text below is about the order fulfillment process. It begins when you confirm that payment has been received. 
Once confirming that payment has been received occurs, one or more of the following paths should be executed: checking that the products are in stock, recording which products were taken from storage. 
Then, getting approval should be done. 
When getting approval is completed, examining your other orders for delivery overlaps should be done. 
When examining your other orders for delivery overlaps is completed, sending a confirmation email to the customer needs to be done. 
The process is now completed.
