The following description is about the order fulfillment process. It begins when you confirm that payment has been received. 
When confirming that payment has been received is completed, one or more of the following paths should be executed: checking that the products are in stock, recording which products were taken from storage. 
After checking that the products are in stock, requesting the ordered products from your inventory needs to be done. 
After that, the process is split into 3 parallel branches: packaging the items securely, printing packing slip and getting approval. 
After printing packing slip, measuring products should be done. 
Once getting approval occurs, one or more of the following paths should be executed: attaching the shipping label to the packaging, printing invoice. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then one or more of the following paths should be executed: arranging the delivery, loading items into the delivery vehicle. 
Then, you need to send a confirmation email to the customer.
The process is now completed.
