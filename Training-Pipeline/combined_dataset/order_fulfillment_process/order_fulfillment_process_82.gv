The text below is about the order fulfillment process. It starts with recording order details. 
Once recording order details occurs, you need to check that the products are in stock.
Once checking that the products are in stock occurs, one or more of the following paths should be executed: measuring products, packaging the items securely. 
Afterwards, loading items into the delivery vehicle needs to be done. 
After loading items into the delivery vehicle, you need to send a confirmation email to the customer.
The process is now completed.
