The text below is about the order fulfillment process. It begins when you record order details. 
After recording order details, performing quality checks needs to be done. 
After performing quality checks, measuring products should be done. 
When measuring products is completed, the process is split into 3 parallel branches: arranging the delivery, loading items into the delivery vehicle and examining your other orders for delivery overlaps. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then sending a confirmation email to the customer needs to be done. 
The process is now completed.
