The following text is about the order fulfillment process. It begins when you confirm that payment has been received. 
Once confirming that payment has been received occurs, one or more of the following paths should be executed: checking that the products are in stock, requesting the ordered products from your inventory. 
Afterwards, printing packing slip needs to be done. 
After printing packing slip, the process is split into 3 parallel branches: examining your other orders for delivery overlaps, loading items into the delivery vehicle and arranging the delivery. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then sending a confirmation email to the customer should be done. 
The process is now completed.
