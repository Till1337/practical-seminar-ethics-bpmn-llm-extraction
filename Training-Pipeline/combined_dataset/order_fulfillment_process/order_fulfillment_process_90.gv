The following text is about the order fulfillment process. It begins when you confirm that payment has been received. 
After confirming that payment has been received, one or more of the following paths should be executed: requesting the ordered products from your inventory, checking that the products are in stock. 
After that, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: packaging the items securely and printing invoice. 
Once all pre-tasks are executed, then one or more of the following paths should be executed: examining your other orders for delivery overlaps, arranging the delivery. 
Afterwards, sending a confirmation email to the customer needs to be done. 
The process is now completed.
