The following text is about the order fulfillment process. It starts with confirming that payment has been received. 
Once confirming that payment has been received occurs, recording which products were taken from storage needs to be done. 
When recording which products were taken from storage is completed, printing packing slip needs to be done. 
When printing packing slip is completed, you need to load items into the delivery vehicle.
After loading items into the delivery vehicle, sending a confirmation email to the customer should be done.
